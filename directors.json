He is also distinguished by his rapid rate of production and his very large body of work. Allen writes and directs his movies and has also acted in the majority of them. For inspiration, Allen draws heavily on literature, sexuality, philosophy, psychology, Jewish identity, and the history of cinema, among a wealth of other fields of interest.\n\nAllen developed a passion for music early on and is a celebrated jazz clarinetist. What began as a teenage avocation has led to regular public performances at various small venues in his hometown of Manhattan, with occasional appearances at various jazz festivals. Allen joined the Preservation Hall Jazz Band and the New Orleans Funeral Ragtime Orchestra in performances that provided the film score for his 1973 comedy Sleeper, and performed in a rare European tour in 1996, which became the subject of the documentary Wild Man Blues.",

He is widely acclaimed as one of Hollywood's most celebrated and influential film directors. He epitomized the group of filmmakers known as the New Hollywood, which included George Lucas, Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman, Woody Allen and William Friedkin, who emerged in the early 1970s with unconventional ideas that challenged contemporary filmmaking.\n\nHe co-authored the script for Patton, winning the Academy Award in 1970. His directorial fame escalated with the release of The Godfather in 1972. The film revolutionized movie-making in the gangster genre, garnering universal laurels from critics and public alike. It went on to win three Academy Awards, including his second, which he won for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was instrumental in cementing his position as one of the prominent American film directors. Coppola followed it with an equally successful sequel The Godfather Part II, which became the first ever sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. The film received yet higher praises than its predecessor, and gave him three Academy Awards\u2014for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director and Best Picture. In the same year was released The Conversation, which he directed, produced and wrote. The film went on to win the Palme d'Or at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival. His next directorial venture was Apocalypse Now in 1979, and it was as notorious for its lengthy and troubled production as it was critically acclaimed for its vivid and stark depiction of the Vietnam War. It won his second Palme d'Or at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nAlthough some of Coppola's ventures in the 1980s and early 1990s were critically lauded, Coppola's later work has not met the same level of critical and commercial success as his '70s films.

He is the only director in the series to be honoured with a Best Director accolade for his work on Harry Potter. He achieved international attention for his award-winning short films early in his career, which led to him becoming a prolific television director with credits including the BBC costume drama The Way We Live Now, the acclaimed political thriller State of Play and the BAFTA-lauded two-part drama Sex Traffic. Due to the success of these dramas and subsequent projects, Yates is considered as one of Britain's most celebrated directors of film and television.\n\nThroughout his works, Yates uses hand-held cameras to visually provoke the subject matter; the technique is noted as one of his directorial trademarks.

        "biography": "Quentin Jerome Tarantino is an American film director, screenwriter, producer, cinematographer and actor. In the early 1990s he was an independent filmmaker whose films used nonlinear storylines and aestheticization of violence. His films have earned him a variety of Academy Award, Golden Globe, BAFTA and Palme d'Or Awards and he has been nominated for Emmy and Grammy Awards. In 2007, Total Film named him the 12th-greatest director of all time.\n\nTarantino was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, the son of Connie McHugh Tarantino Zastoupil, a health care executive and nurse born in Knoxville, and Tony Tarantino, an actor and amateur musician born in Queens, New York.\n\nTarantino's mother allowed him to quit school at age 17, to attend an acting class full time. Tarantino gave up acting while attending the acting school, saying that he admired directors more than actors. Tarantino also worked in a video rental store before becoming a filmmaker, paid close attention to the types of films people liked to rent, and has cited that experience as inspiration for his directorial career.\n\nTarantino has been romantically linked with numerous entertainers, including actress Mira Sorvino, directors Allison Anders and Sofia Coppola, actresses Julie Dreyfus and Shar Jackson and comedians Kathy Griffin and Margaret Cho. There have also been rumors about his relationship with Uma Thurman, whom he has referred to as his \"muse\". However, Tarantino has stated that their relationship is strictly platonic. He has never married and has no children.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article\u00a0Quentin Tarantino, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "Hayao Miyazaki (Miyazaki Hayao, born January 5, 1941) is a Japanese manga artist and prominent film director and animator of many popular anime feature films. Through a career that has spanned nearly five decades, Miyazaki has attained international acclaim as a maker of animated feature films and, along with Isao Takahata, co-founded Studio Ghibli, an animation studio and production company. The success of Miyazaki's films has invited comparisons with American animator Walt Disney, British animator Nick Park as well as Robert Zemeckis, who pioneered Motion Capture animation, and he has been named one of the most influential people by Time Magazine.\n\nMiyazaki began his career at Toei Animation as an in-between artist for Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon where he pitched his own ideas that eventually became the movie's ending. He continued to work in various roles in the animation industry over the decade until he was able to direct his first feature film Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro which was published in 1979. After the success of his next film, Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind, he co-founded Studio Ghibli where he continued to produce many feature films until Princess Mononoke whereafter he temporarily retired.\n\nWhile Miyazaki's films have long enjoyed both commercial and critical success in Japan, he remained largely unknown to the West until Miramax released his 1997 film, Princess Mononoke. Princess Mononoke was the highest-grossing film in Japan\u2014until it was eclipsed by another 1997 film, Titanic\u2014and the first animated film to win Picture of the Year at the Japanese Academy Awards. Miyazaki returned to animation with Spirited Away. The film topped Titanic's sales at the Japanese box office, also won Picture of the Year at the Japanese Academy Awards and was the first anime film to win an American Academy Award.\n\nMiyazaki's films often incorporate recurrent themes, such as humanity's relationship to nature and technology, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic. Reflecting Miyazaki's feminism, the protagonists of his films are often strong, independent girls or young women. Miyazaki is a vocal critic of capitalism and globalization.[3] While two of his films, The Castle of Cagliostro and Castle in the Sky, involve traditional villains, his other films such as Nausicaa or Princess Mononoke present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities.",

His siblings are Janine, Claire, Diane and Steven. His father was of Polish descent and worked as a nuclear physicist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In 1967 the Verbinski family moved to Southern California, where a young Gregor grew up in the town of La Jolla.\n\nGregor was an active Boy Scout and surfed regularly. He went to Torrey Pines Elementary, Muirlands Junior High, and La Jolla High School before attending UCLA Film School. Verbinski graduated with his BFA in Film from UCLA in 1987.\n\nVerbinski was active in several L.A. rock bands early in his career. His first band was Thelonius Monster, which included drummer Danny Heifetz. He also played in the Daredevils, Bulldozer, The Drivers, and the all-star band The Cylon Boys Choir.\n\nHe was also in a band called The Little Kings, which backed Stiv Bators on his version of \"Have Love Will Travel\". Along with a cover of the Moody Blues song \"The Story in Your Eyes\" (by other musicians), the song was released by Bators in the Fall of 1986 as a 12-inch single on Bomp! (catalogue #12136) and was later included in Bators' compilation album L.A. L.A. On the compilation album's liner notes, label owner Greg Shaw described the band as \"an adequate but rootless Hollywood glam-damaged band with tattoos\".\n\nHis first films were a series of 8 mm films called \"The Driver Files\" circa 1979, when he was a young teen. Although most associate Verbinski with feature films, he started his career directing music videos for bands like Bad Religion, NOFX, 24-7 Spyz and Monster Magnet working at Palomar Pictures. This was not surprising to his friends in Los Angeles, since he had been in various punk and rock bands; the Daredevils, for instance, included then-departed member of Bad Religion Brett Gurewitz.\n\nVerbinski moved from music videos to commercials, where he worked for many brand names including Nike, Coca-Cola, Canon, Skittles and United Airlines. One of his most famous commercials was for Budweiser, featuring frogs who croak the brand name. For his efforts in commercials, Verbinski won four Clio Awards and one Cannes Advertising Silver Lion.\n\nAfter completing a short film, The Ritual (which he both wrote and directed), Verbinski made his feature film directing debut with his comedy flick, Mouse Hunt. The film was a hit globally and he soon followed up the success with the action/comedy The Mexican, starring Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt. The film received mixed reviews, and performed modestly at the box-office, earning $68 million domestically which was quite meager considering its star power (it was technically successful due to its moderately low $38 million budget). Verbinski followed it up with the horror film remake The Ring (2002), which struck gold globally, grossing well over $200 million worldwide. Verbinski also had a directorial hand in The Time Machine that year, temporarily taking over for an exhausted Simon Wells. Verbinski directed some of the underground Morlock sequences and is given a Thanks to credit in the film.\n\nHe then directed the very successful Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl which earned over $600 million at the international box office.\n\nHis next film was The Weather Man which starred Nicolas Cage. The film received mixed to positive reviews but was a box office failure.\n\nIn March 2005 he started filming the sequels Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. The former then became his biggest success so far, becoming the third film ever to gross over $1 billion at the international box office.\n\nHis future project will be an adaption of William Monahan's novel Light House: A Trifle, which is a story about an artist running away from the Mafia who hides in a lighthouse, in which kooky characters live. He will also direct Butterfly, about a man trying to drive his wife insane.\n\nVerbinski was also set to direct a film for Universal based on the video game, BioShock. \u00a0However he has since been replaced by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo as director, but he will still produce. Verbinski announced in July the film had an R-rating, formerly was planned with an PG-13 rating. It has also been announced that he direct a remake of the film Clue, based on the board game.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article\u00a0Gore Verbinski, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

The son of an engineer, he majored in physics at California State University but, after graduating, drove a truck to support his screen-writing ambition. He landed his first professional film job as art director, miniature-set builder, and process-projection supervisor on Roger Corman's Battle Beyond the Stars (1980) and debuted as a director with Piranha Part Two: The Spawning (1981) the following year. In 1984, he wrote and directed The Terminator (1984), a futuristic action-thriller starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Michael Biehn, and Linda Hamilton. It was a huge success. After this came a string of successful science-fiction action films such as Aliens (1986) and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). Cameron is now one of the most sought-after directors in Hollywood. He was formerly married to producer Gale Anne Hurd, who produced several of his films. He married Kathryn Bigelow in 1989.",

        "biography": "Scott was born in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, England, the son of Elizabeth and Colonel Francis Percy Scott. He was raised in an Army family, meaning that for most of his early life, his father \u2014 an officer in the Royal Engineers \u2014 was absent. Ridley's older brother, Frank, joined the Merchant Navy when he was still young and the pair had little contact. During this time the family moved around, living in (among other areas) Cumbria, Wales and Germany. He has a younger brother, Tony, also a film director. After the Second World War, the Scott family moved back to their native north-east England, eventually settling in Teesside (whose industrial landscape would later inspire similar scenes in Blade Runner). He enjoyed watching films, and his favourites include Lawrence of Arabia, Citizen Kane and Seven Samurai. Scott studied in Teesside from 1954 to 1958, at Grangefield Grammar School and later in West Hartlepool College of Art, graduating with a Diploma in Design. He progressed to an M.A. in graphic design at the Royal College of Art from 1960 to 1962.\n\nAt the RCA he contributed to the college magazine, ARK and helped to establish its film department. For his final show, he made a black and white short film, Boy and Bicycle, starring his younger brother, Tony Scott, and his father. The film's main visual elements would become features of Scott's later work; it was issued on the 'Extras' section of The Duellists DVD. After graduation in 1963, he secured a job as a trainee set designer with the BBC, leading to work on the popular television police series Z-Cars and the science fiction series Out of the Unknown. Scott was an admirer of Stanley Kubrick early in his development as a director. For his entry to the BBC traineeship, Scott remade Paths of Glory as a short film.\n\nHe was assigned to design the second Doctor Who serial, The Daleks, which would have entailed realising the famous alien creatures. However, shortly before Scott was due to start work, a schedule conflict meant that he was replaced on the serial by Raymond Cusick.\n\nAt the BBC, Scott was placed into a director training programme and, before he left the corporation, had directed episodes of Z-Cars, its spin-off, Softly, Softly, and adventure series Adam Adamant Lives!\n\nIn 1968, Ridley and Tony Scott founded Ridley Scott Associates (RSA), a film and commercial production company.Five members of the Scott family are directors, all working for RSA. Brother Tony has been a successful film director for more than two decades; sons, Jake and Luke are both acclaimed commercials directors as is his daughter, Jordan Scott. Jake and Jordan both work from Los Angeles and Luke is based in London.\n\nIn 1995, Shepperton Studios was purchased by a consortium headed by Ridley and Tony Scott, which extensively renovated the studios while also expanding and improving its grounds. \u00a0",

        "biography": "Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock, KBE (13 August 1899 \u2013 29 April 1980) was an Anglo-American director and producer. He pioneered many techniques in the suspense and psychological thriller genres. After a successful career in his native United Kingdom in both silent films and early talkies, Hitchcock moved to Hollywood. In 1956 he became an American citizen while remaining a British subject.\n\nOver a career spanning more than half a century, Hitchcock fashioned for himself a distinctive and recognizable directorial style. He pioneered the use of a camera made to move in a way that mimics a person's gaze, forcing viewers to engage in a form of voyeurism. He framed shots to maximize anxiety, fear, or empathy, and used innovative film editing. His stories frequently feature fugitives on the run from the law alongside \"icy blonde\" female characters. Many of Hitchcock's films have twist endings and thrilling plots featuring depictions of violence, murder, and crime, although many of the mysteries function as decoys or \"MacGuffins\" meant only to serve thematic elements in the film and the extremely complex psychological examinations of the characters. Hitchcock's films also borrow many themes from psychoanalysis and feature strong sexual undertones. Through his cameo appearances in his own films, interviews, film trailers, and the television program Alfred Hitchcock Presents, he became a cultural icon.\n\nHitchcock directed more than fifty feature films in a career spanning six decades. Often regarded as the greatest British filmmaker, he came first in a 2007 poll of film critics in Britain's Daily Telegraph, which said: \"Unquestionably the greatest filmmaker to emerge from these islands, Hitchcock did more than any director to shape modern cinema, which would be utterly different without him. His flair was for narrative, cruelly withholding crucial information (from his characters and from us) and engaging the emotions of the audience like no one else.\" The magazine MovieMaker has described him as the most influential filmmaker of all-time, and he is widely regarded as one of cinema's most significant artists.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Alfred Hitchcock, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Next he directed the film, Set It Off, with Jada Pinkett and Queen Latifah. He then went on to direct The Negotiator. The film starred Academy Award winner Kevin Spacey and Oscar nominee Samuel L. Jackson, and earned Gray both Best Film and Best Director awards at the 1998 Acapulco Film Festival.\n\nGray is also known for The Italian Job, an action-thriller starring Academy Award winner Charlize Theron and Oscar nominee Mark Wahlberg.

Shyamalan released his first film, Praying with Anger, in 1992 while he was a New York University student. His second movie, the major feature film Wide Awake, made in 1995 but not released until three years later, did not succeed financially.\n\nShyamalan gained international recognition when he wrote and directed 1999's The Sixth Sense, which was a commercial success and nominated for six Academy Awards, including: Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay. He followed The Sixth Sense by writing and directing Unbreakable, released in 2000, which received positive reviews. His 2002 film Signs, where he also played Ray Reddy, gained both critical and financial success. His next movie The Village (2004) received mixed reviews from the critics, but turned out to be a financial success. His later fantasy film Lady in the Water (2006) performed worse critically and financially. The film The Happening (2008) was a financial success but also received negative reviews.

He studied filmmaking in Prague and made several films in his native country during the 1960s, including his first, Magic Lantern II (1960), before leaving for America. His first American film, Taking Off (1971), received little attention. But the follow-up, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975), was an unqualified success and earned Forman a Best Director Oscar. After adaptations of the musical \"Hair\" (1970) and the book Ragtime (1981), Forman directed the Mozart biography Amadeus (1984), which garnered a second Oscar for directing. He continued to strike gold in the biography genre with the Oscar-nominated The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996) and Man on the Moon (1999), which chronicled the bizarre life of comedian Andy Kaufman.",

        "biography": "Stanley Kubrick (July 26, 1928 \u2013 March 7, 1999) was an American film director, writer, producer, and photographer who lived in England during most of the last four decades of his career. Kubrick was noted for the scrupulous care with which he chose his subjects, his slow method of working, the variety of genres he worked in, his technical perfectionism, and his reclusiveness about his films and personal life. He maintained almost complete artistic control, making movies according to his own whims and time constraints, but with the rare advantage of big-studio financial support for all his endeavors. Kubrick's films are characterized by a formal visual style and meticulous attention to detail\u2014his later films often have elements of surrealism and expressionism that eschews structured linear narrative. His films are repeatedly described as slow and methodical, and are often perceived as a reflection of his obsessive and perfectionist nature. A recurring theme in his films is man's inhumanity to man. While often viewed as expressing an ironic pessimism, a few critics feel his films contain a cautious optimism when viewed more carefully.\n\nThe film that first brought him attention to many critics was Paths of Glory, the first of three films of his about the dehumanizing effects of war. Many of his films at first got a lukewarm reception, only to be years later acclaimed as masterpieces that had a seminal influence on many later generations of film-makers. Considered especially groundbreaking was 2001: A Space Odyssey noted for being both one of the most scientifically realistic and visually innovative science-fiction films ever made while maintaining an enigmatic non-linear storyline. He voluntarily withdrew his film A Clockwork Orange from England, after it was accused of inspiring copycat crimes which in turn resulted in threats against Kubrick's family. His films were largely successful at the box-office, although Barry Lyndon performed poorly in the United States. Living authors Anthony Burgess and Stephen King were both unhappy with Kubrick's adaptations of their novels A Clockwork Orange and The Shining respectively, and both authors were engaged with subsequent adaptations. All of Kubrick's films from the mid-1950s to his death except for The Shining were nominated for Oscars, Golden Globes, or BAFTAs. Although he was nominated for an Academy Award as a screenwriter and director on several occasions, his only personal win was for the special effects in 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nEven though all of his films, apart from the first two, were adapted from novels or short stories, his works have been described by Jason Ankeny and others as \"original and visionary\". Although some critics, notably Andrew Sarris and Pauline Kael, frequently disparaged Kubrick's work, Ankeny describes Kubrick as one of the most \"universally acclaimed and influential directors of the postwar era\" with a \"standing unique among the filmmakers of his day.\"\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Stanley Kubrick, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Ernst Hofbauer (b. 22 August 1925 Vienna, Austria - d. 24 February 1984 Munich, Germany at age 58) was an Austrian film director. During the early 1970s, in Munich, Hofbauer teamed with Walter Boos, Wolf C. Hartwig, and Ludwig Spitaler to produce the original thirteen films under the banner Schulmadchen Report (or Schoolgirl Report); the stories were adapted from books written by Guenther Hunold, while Guenther Heller composed the film script, Klaus Werner did the camera work, and the music was handled by Gert Wilden &amp; Orchestra. Hofbauer and Boos were referred to as the 'Titans of Teen Libido'. The films were classified as 'sexploitation', and were extremely popular, seen by more than 30 million people all over the world. In the United States, the films were released in grindhouses and drive-ins, and the names of the films were changed to conform to American standards. Because the films focused on young girls who may have been under legal age in this country, the Schoolgirl Report series was eventually suppressed. The Schoolgirl Report series was very interesting because the films portrayed many unknown teenagers and actresses who were vibrant, beautiful, naive, innocent, and unabashed. Most of the films related a series of vignettes to tell an interesting story. Hidden pedophile lust, co-ed skinnydipping, situations involving first-time sexual experiences, and encounters with teachers were all shown in the episodes. Interracial love affairs, male and female masturbation sequences, forced prostitution, rape, voyeurism, harmless erotic games, seduction, and erotic touching are also portrayed in the vignettes. Well-known German sex kitten Ingrid Steeger and the ever-horny Italian comic Rinaldo Talamonti play key roles in many of the vignettes. Rosl Mayr appears in almost all of the thirteen Schulmadchen Report films as an elderly lady with a comic role. She is perfectly cast as a comedic talent and is the only senior actress that plays a key element in many of the vignettes. Marie Ekorre, Sonja Jeannine, Christina Lindberg, and Birgit Tetzlaff are a few of the young actresses who titillate the audience with their erotic encounters. Friedrich von Thon conducted street interviews to discuss the plots in the vignettes, and many of the situations were followed up with a courtroom setting (the male actors were charged with statutory rape). The Schoolgirl Report films were classified as 'soft-core' eroticism, which is similar to the David Hamilton genre. Ernst Hofbauer directed many erotic films in addition to the original thirteen Schulmadchen Report classics. Sex sells, and Hofbauer exploited consumer demand for R-rated movies involving young actors and actresses. He had a unique style that combined youth, eroticism, wit, and anecdote. His exploitation films of the 1970s appealed to moviegoers from all walks of life.

In his earlier years, he played football -- a vocation that stayed with him into his college career. While he was at Saint Mary's College of California, his English professor, Rosemary Graham, suggested that Coogler consider a screenwriting career. Coogler then attended Sacramento State, and later, USC School of Cinematic Arts, eventually directing four short films while there: Locks (2009), Fig (2011), The Sculptor (2011), and Gap (2011). Three of these shorts either won or were nominated for different awards. \n\nCoogler's first feature film was titled Fruitvale, and later Fruitvale Station (2013). It is based on the final 24 hours of Oscar Grant's life, before he was shot and killed by one of Oakland's Fruitvale BART station's police officers, on the first day of 2009. Produced by actor-director Forest Whitaker, the feature starring Michael B. Jordan won many awards. Coogler then directed Creed (2015), a sequel/spin-off of the Rocky movies. It won critical accolades for both him and actor Jordan, who had collaborated with Coogler again. \n\nIn early 2016, Coogler was slated to direct and jointly write the script for Marvel Studios' feature film, Black Panther.

        "biography": "Chris is a 2005 graduate from the School of Visual Arts with a BFA in animation, specifically acquired to become a more efficient filmmaker. Majoring in Stop-Motion animation, (a sub genre in which films like \"Corpse Bride\" and \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" are made) Chris learned various techniques in the art of special FX making, from makeup and prosthetics to set design and prop building.\n\nUpon his graduation, Chris had already amassed nearly twenty short film credits to his resume and by 2010, well over 120. With dozens of short films under his belt, including the very popular online horror fan film, \"The Nightmare Ends on Halloween\", one of 2004's most talked about videos; The equally popular sequel \"Friday the 31st (Michael vs Jason), which received so many online plays that it crashed the Blinky Productions website on two separate occasions; Chris' notorious online film serials, \"Catwoman\", \"Powergirl\" and the ever popular and fan favorite \"Krueger: Tales from Elm Street\" series, it was not a far fetch that feature films would be the next logical step for Chris.\n\nIn August of 2007, Chris began work on his first feature film, \"Methodic\", which is also officially, the world's first basher movie- a sub genre of horror created by Chris himself. The phrase was coined after deciding that the killer in \"Methodic\" would actually beat and bash his victims to death.\n\nShot for a next to nothing budget, in a record breaking 10 day shoot, Chris made \"Methodic\" into everything he felt the horror genre represented. \"Methodic\" hit stores on DVD, world wide September of 2009. Since then, Chris has amassed a notable fan base via Youtube and Facebook as well as his own website which has received over 5 million hits.\n\nChris is also CEO of his own company, Blinky Productions Inc., which operates out of Jersey City, New Jersey and has produced dozens of commercials, music videos and event coverage. In 2011, Chris then produced his second feature film, a gritty crime thriller entitled \"Stand Off\". Recently, Chris created a new series of top notch shorts including the award winning \"Choice\", \"Roses\", \"Host\" and \"Superhero\". He also, along with his father have produced an ongoing comic book based on the 2006, award winning short film, \"The Protector\". His most recent feature film release is \"Perfect: Android Rising\".",

        "biography": "Clinton \"Clint\" Eastwood, Jr. (born May 31, 1930) is an American film actor, director, producer, composer and politician. Following his breakthrough role on the TV series Rawhide (1959\u201365), Eastwood starred as the Man with No Name in Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy of spaghetti westerns (A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) in the 1960s, and as San Francisco Police Department Inspector Harry Callahan in the Dirty Harry films (Dirty Harry, Magnum Force, The Enforcer, Sudden Impact, and The Dead Pool) during the 1970s and 1980s. These roles, along with several others in which he plays tough-talking no-nonsense police officers, have made him an enduring cultural icon of masculinity.\n\nEastwood won Academy Awards for Best Director and Producer of the Best Picture, as well as receiving nominations for Best Actor, for his work in the films Unforgiven (1992) and Million Dollar Baby (2004). These films in particular, as well as others including Play Misty for Me (1971), The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), Pale Rider (1985), In the Line of Fire (1993), The Bridges of Madison County (1995), and Gran Torino (2008), have all received commercial success and/or critical acclaim. Eastwood's only comedies have been Every Which Way but Loose (1978) and its sequel Any Which Way You Can (1980); despite being widely panned by critics they are the two highest-grossing films of his career after adjusting for inflation.\n\nEastwood has directed most of his own star vehicles, but he has also directed films in which he did not appear such as Mystic River (2003) and Letters from Iwo Jima (2006), for which he received Academy Award nominations and Changeling (2008), which received Golden Globe Award nominations. He has received considerable critical praise in France in particular, including for several of his films which were panned in the United States, and was awarded two of France's highest honors: in 1994 he received the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres medal and in 2007 was awarded the L\u00e9gion d'honneur medal. In 2000 he was awarded the Italian Venice Film Festival Golden Lion for lifetime achievement.\n\nSince 1967 Eastwood has run his own production company, Malpaso, which has produced the vast majority of his films. He also served as the nonpartisan mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, from 1986 to 1988. Eastwood has seven children by five women, although he has only married twice. An audiophile, Eastwood is also associated with jazz and has composed and performed pieces in several films along with his eldest son, Kyle Eastwood.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Clint Eastwood, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

After several second unit director's assignments in special effects-heavy films like Men in Black and Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor, Brevig's previous 3D experience and expertise turned out to be the factor that helped him get his first full-blown director's job when he was offered the chance to direct the 2008 film Journey to the Center of the Earth 3-D (a New Line Cinema release), the first narrative feature shot entirely in digital 3-D. He next directed Yogi Bear, another 3-D movie, for Warner Bros., and he is attached to direct a 3-D Korean War drama, 17 Days of Winter, about the 1950 Battle of Chosin Reservoir. 17 Days of Winter, expected to cost $80\u2013100 million, is scheduled to shoot in Korea and New Zealand over the winter of 2010-2011 for 2012 release.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Eric Brevig, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He won a scholarship to the University of Southern California to study at the USC School of Cinema-Television. He made two short films at USC, The Goodbye Place and Visceral Matter, before graduating in 1997.\n\nDonnie Darko was his first feature and was nominated for 21 small awards, winning 11 of them, including a nomination for a Saturn Award. The film later ended up #2 on Empire magazine's list of 50 greatest independent films of all time, behind Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs.\n\nAlthough Kelly's films differ considerably in setting and characters (Donnie Darko is about a suburban teenager, Southland Tales is an L.A. epic, and The Box is about a married couple in Richmond, Virginia), they share similar themes of time travel, existentialism, and spirituality.\n\nKelly's enthusiasm and direction can be traced back to his viewing of the film Brazil, as told to author Robert K. Elder in an interview for The Film That Changed My Life.\n\nIn 2016, filmmaker Kevin Smith said of Kelly: \"He is insanely creative and is not unlike Christopher Nolan. But Nolan wound up in the Warner Bros. system where he got special handling, and he got a lot of money to make huge art films like Inception. Richard can be one of our greatest filmmakers.

        "biography": "John Howard Carpenter (born January 16, 1948) is an American film director, screenwriter, producer, editor, composer, and occasional actor. Although Carpenter has worked in numerous film genres in his four-decade career, his name is most commonly associated with horror and science fiction.\n\nMost films in Carpenter's career were initially commercial and critical failures, with the notable exceptions of Halloween (1978), The Fog (1980), Escape from New York (1981), and Starman (1984). However, many of Carpenter's films from the 1970s and the 1980s have come to be viewed as cult classics, and he has been acknowledged as an influential filmmaker. Cult classics that Carpenter directed include: Dark Star (1974), Assault on Precinct 13 (1976), The Thing (1982), Christine (1983), Big Trouble in Little China (1986), Prince of Darkness (1987), They Live (1988) and In the Mouth of Madness (1995).\n\nHis films are characterized by minimalist lighting and photography, static cameras, use of steadicam, and distinctive synthesized scores. Carpenter is also notable for having composed or co-composed most of the music of his films; some of them are now considered cult as well, with the main theme of Halloween being considered a part of popular culture. His music is generally synthesized with accompaniment from piano and atmospherics. He released his first studio album Lost Themes in 2015, and also won a Saturn Award for Best Music for Vampires (1998).\n\nCarpenter is an outspoken proponent of widescreen filming, and all of his theatrical movies (with the exception of Dark Star and The Ward) were filmed anamorphic with a 2.35:1 or greater aspect ratio. The Ward was shot in Super 35, the first time Carpenter has ever used that system. Carpenter has stated he feels that the 35mm Panavision anamorphic format is \"the best movie system there is\", preferring it over both digital and 3D film.\n\nMany of Carpenter's films have been re-released on DVD as special editions with numerous bonus features.  \n\nCarpenter has been the subject of the documentary film John Carpenter: The Man and His Movies, and American Cinematheque's 2002 retrospective of his films. Moreover, in 2006, the United States Library of Congress deemed Halloween to be \"culturally significant\" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.\n\nIn 2010, writer and actor Mark Gatiss interviewed Carpenter about his career and films for his BBC documentary series A History of Horror. Carpenter appears in all three episodes of the series. He was also interviewed by Robert Rodriguez for his The Director's Chair series on El Rey Network.\n\nMany filmmakers have been influenced by Carpenter, including James Cameron, Quentin Tarantino ((The Hateful Eight was heavily influenced by The Thing), Guillermo del Toro, Robert Rodriguez, Edgar Wright, Danny Boyle, Nicolas Winding Refn, Bong Joon-ho, among others. The video game Dead Space 3 is said to be influenced by Carpenter's The Thing, The Fog and Halloween, and Carpenter has stated that he would be enthusiastic to adapt that series into a feature film.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article John Carpenter, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

Since then he worked as a moviemaker. \"CARLO\" (prod.

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nMartin Koolhoven (born April 25, 1969 in The Hague) is a Dutch film director and screenwriter.\n\nBorn as Martinus Wouter Koolhoven, Koolhoven graduated from Dutch film school in 1996 and almost immediately made an impact on the Dutch film industry with his 53 minute television film Duister Licht (\"Dark Light\") in which the slaughtering of a pig was shown. The film was nominated twice at the Dutch Film Festival.\n\nIt was his next (and first feature length) film however that established his name, also outside of the Netherlands. Suzy Q (also made for television) became the most awarded Dutch film of 1999 and established both Koolhoven's career and that of actress Carice van Houten, who Koolhoven worked with several times in the films to come.\n\nHis first film for the cinema, AmnesiA, got a small theatical release in New York.\n\nKoolhoven started off with strongly stylized films that were all hailed by the critics, but never gained commercial success. In 2005 that changed when he went into the mainstream with Schnitzel Paradise, that not only got him rave reviews (both inside and outside the Netherlands), but was the highest grossing Dutch film of that year. The film was shown at many international film festivals (amongst them the Berlin Film Festival and the Karlovy Vary Film Festival where it was part of the Variety Critic's choice.) The film was sold to more than 20 countries, which is a remarkable amount for a Dutch film.\n\nIn the same year Koolhoven released Bonkers, which internationally became his most awarded film and performed well at the box office. He also was the first director to have two films in the Dutch box office top 20.\n\n\"n Beetje Verliefd (2006) (Happy Family) was his third hit film in two years time, earning him another Golden Film. It was followed in 2008 by Oorlogswinter (Winter in Wartime), a Dutch movie based on the hit novel by the same name, written by Jan Terlouw, which went platinum. The movie was praised by almost all critics (including Variety that wrote a raving review) and was an enormous succes at the box office, being the number one movie at Christmas 2008 in The Netherlands. Winter in Wartime grossed more money than all previous movies Koolhoven made together. The movie outgrossed competing movies like The Dark Night and Twilight and was the Dutch entry for the Academy Awards. It made the shortlist of 9 movies, but failed to get nominated. The movie is being distributed in the United States by Sony Classics.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Martin Koolhoven, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He made his directorial debut with the short film Partly Cloudy in 2009 which he also wrote. In a CGSociety article, Sohn says his idea for Partly Cloudy came from watching Dumbo as a child. In the movie, a stork delivers Dumbo. This made him wonder where the bird gets the babies from. He decided the babies came from clouds and so that is why birds have to deliver them. Partly Cloudy was included in the Animation Show of Shows in 2009.\n\nSohn was born and raised in New York. He attended CalArts and while there got a summer job working on Brad Bird's The Iron Giant.

He also wrote and co-produced The Truman Show, which earned him an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay in 1999 and won him a BAFTA award for Best Screenplay. Many of his films, such as Gattaca, S1m0ne and The Truman Show view societal or political issues through a fantasy-science fiction lens. Lord of War, however, was a contemporary, matter-of-fact exploration of gunrunning.\n\nNiccol was born in Paraparaumu, New Zealand in 1964 and grew up in Auckland, where he attended Auckland Grammar School. He left New Zealand at age 21 and began directing commercials in London, England. During the production of S1m0ne, he met model Rachel Roberts, with whom he has a son, Jack in 2003, and a daughter, Ava in 2008.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Andrew Niccol, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

As a child, Doug drew cartoons for the Central Pennsylvania Festival of the Arts for several years. After graduating high school in 1992, Doug opted to attend California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) and pursue his life-long love and passion for animation.\n\nIn 1994, he decided to leave school in his final year to join Pixar. His first assignment was as an animator on Toy Story. He continued as animator on A Bug's Life and Toy Story 2. He was nominated for an Annie Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement for Character Animation for Toy Story 2. Doug continued to build an incredible reputation as one of the best animators in the business. He was awarded back to back ANNIE awards for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Character Animation for Monsters, Inc. and Finding Nemo. Doug took on the lead animator role for Bud Luckey\u2019s Oscar-nominated Boundin' short and worked as an animator and storyboard artist on the Oscar-winning The Incredibles. Sweetland followed this up by stepping into the supervising animator role on John Lasseter\u2019s Cars.\n\nIn 2007, Doug pitched a short film about a sympathetic magician who gets \u201cdumped\u201d by his rabbit. This eventually evolved to a more slapstick film (and a throwback to Warner Bros. classic Looney Tunes). Teddy Newton was brought on board to design the characters; it emerged as Sweetland\u2019s directorial debut. Presto was very well received by audiences and critics alike when it preceded WALL-E in theaters. It was honored in 2008 with an Academy Award nomination in the Best Animated Short Film category. It was included in the Animation Show of Shows in 2008.\n\nOn September 24, 2010, it was reported that Sweetland had been hired by Sony Pictures Animation to direct a computer-animated film The Familiars.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Doug Sweetland, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "As a child growing up in Washington, DC, Ruben Fleischer never dreamed of being a director. But after working as the assistant to Miguel Arteta on Chuck &amp; Buck and The Good Girl, Ruben had incredible first hand access to see what directing was all about. After those experiences, Ruben quit working and spent the next two years making various low budget music videos, short films, and other experiments, thereby putting himself embarrassingly deep into credit card debt in his attempt to be a \"director.\" Luckily, people started to watch and enjoy his videos, which led to him getting signed to a production company where he was able to direct commercials and bigger budget music videos. Through making\u00a0Six Days In May, a documentary about the Gumball Rally (a modern day Cannonball Run), Ruben met Rob &amp; Big Black, with whom he created and developed\u00a0Rob &amp; Big, a hit reality television show on MTV. After three successful seasons, the show ended, only to be followed up by\u00a0Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory. On the feature side, Ruben directed his first feature,\u00a0Zombieland, a Zom-Com about the post-apocalyptic zombie world starring Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin. \u00a0His second film,\u00a030 Minutes or Less,\u00a0is a twisted dark comedy starring Jesse Eisenberg, Danny McBride, Aziz Ansari, Nick Swardson and Michael Pena.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nRichard O. Fleischer (December 8, 1916 \u2013 March 25, 2006) was an American film director.\n\nFleischer was born in Brooklyn, the son of Essie (n\u00e9e Goldstein) and animator/producer Max Fleischer. After graduating from Brown University, he went to Yale School of Drama, where he met his future wife, Mary Dickson.\n\nHis film career began in 1942 at the RKO studio, directing shorts, documentaries, and compilations of forgotten silent features.\n\nFleischer moved to Los Angeles and was assigned his first feature, Child of Divorce (1946).  In 1954, he was chosen by Walt Disney (his father's former rival as a cartoon producer) to direct 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea starring Kirk Douglas. \n\nIn 1955 Fox signed Fleischer to a long term contract. He would work for that studio for the next fifteen years. His first film under his new contract with Fox was The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing (1955). Kirk Douglas hired Fleischer to make The Vikings (1958), which was another big hit. \n\nHe then moved to Paris where he directed two stories for Darryl F. Zanuck starring Greco. Fleischer then signed a contract with Dino de Laurentiis to make Barabbas (1962). \n\nBack in Hollywood, Richard Zanuck had become head of production at Fox and offered Fleischer Fantastic Voyage (1966). It was a success and resurrected his Hollywood career. \n\nChe! (1969), a biopic of Che Guevera that starred Omar Sharif, was an expensive flop, as was an account of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970). This was his last film for 20th Century Fox.\n\nFleischer travelled to England, where he directed an acclaimed thriller, 10 Rillington Place. See No Evil (1971) with Mia Farrow was another thriller. In Hollywood, he made The New Centurions (1972). At MGM, he made a science-fiction film, Soylent Green (1973), with Charlton Heston.\n\nHe was reunited with De Laurentiis for the popular, if controversial, Mandingo (1975). \n\nThe Prince and the Pauper (1977) was a version of the Mark Twain novel that featured Heston, Harrison and Scott in its cast. Fleischer was then hired on Ashanti (1979), starring Michael Caine, which turned out to be a flop. \n\nTough Enough (1983) was about the Toughman Contest starring Dennis Quaid. He made three more for de Laurentiis. His final theatrical feature was Million Dollar Mystery (1987).\n\nFleischer was chairman of Fleischer Studios, which today handles the licensing of Betty Boop and Koko the Clown. In June 2005, he released his memoirs of his father's career in Out of the Inkwell: Max Fleischer and the Animation Revolution.\n\nFleischer's 1993 autobiography, Just Tell Me When to Cry, described his many difficulties with actors, writers and producers.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Richard O.

He did the climatic dinosaur fight in\u00a0Igor Stravinsky's\u00a0The Rite of Spring\u00a0in\u00a0Fantasia, the Headless Horseman chase in \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" section in\u00a0The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad, the Crocodile in\u00a0Peter Pan, and\u00a0Maleficent\u00a0as a dragon in\u00a0Sleeping Beauty\u00a0(the former three he animated and the latter he directed). Beginning with 1961's\u00a0One Hundred and One Dalmatians, \"Woolie\", as he was called by friends, served as Disney's chief animation director. One of Reitherman's productions, the 1968 short\u00a0Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day, won the\u00a0Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. He also served as a producer and sequence director, and starred as himself in the 1941 feature film\u00a0The Reluctant Dragon. All three of Reitherman's sons \u2014\u00a0Bruce, Richard and Robert \u2014 provided voices for Disney characters, including Mowgli in\u00a0The Jungle Book,\u00a0Christopher Robin\u00a0in\u00a0Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree, and\u00a0Wart\u00a0in\u00a0The Sword in the Stone.

Reuse was just Woolie\u2019s thing. He never did it to save money. I really don\u2019t think the \u201cOld Guard\u201d ever had any interest in saving money. I was never a big fan of reuse, but it wasn\u2019t my place to tell these old guys what to do. One final thought.

Known for his surrealist films, he has developed his own unique cinematic style, which has been dubbed \"Lynchian\", and which is characterized by its dream imagery and meticulous sound design. Indeed, the surreal and in many cases violent elements to his films have earned them the reputation that they \"disturb, offend or mystify\" their audiences.\n\nMoving around various parts of the United States as a child within his middle class family, Lynch went on to study painting in Philadelphia, where he first made the transition to producing short films. Deciding to devote himself more fully to this medium, he moved to Los Angeles, where he produced his first motion picture, the surrealist horror Eraserhead (1977). After Eraserhead became a cult classic on the midnight movie circuit, Lynch was employed to direct The Elephant Man (1980), from which he gained mainstream success. Then being employed by the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, he proceeded to make two films. First, the science-fiction epic Dune (1984), which proved to be a critical and commercial failure, and then a neo-noir crime film, Blue Velvet (1986), which was highly critically acclaimed.\n\nProceeding to create his own television series with Mark Frost, the highly popular murder mystery Twin Peaks (1990\u20131992), he also created a cinematic prequel, Fire Walk With Me (1992), a road movie, Wild at Heart (1990), and a family film, The Straight Story (1999) in the same period. Turning further towards surrealist filmmaking, three of his following films worked on \"dream logic\" non-linear narrative structures, Lost Highway (1997), Mulholland Drive (2001) and Inland Empire (2006).\n\nLynch has received three Academy Award nominations for Best Director, for his films The Elephant Man, Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive, and also received a screenplay Academy Award nomination for The Elephant Man. Lynch has twice won France's C\u00e9sar Award for Best Foreign Film, as well as the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and a Golden Lion award for lifetime achievement at the Venice Film Festival. The French government awarded him the Legion of Honor, the country's top civilian honor, as a Chevalier in 2002 and then an Officier in 2007, while that same year, The Guardian described Lynch as \"the most important director of this era\". Allmovie called him \"the Renaissance man of modern American filmmaking\", whilst the success of his films have led to him being labelled \"the first popular Surrealist.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.  Billy Wilder (22 June 1906 \u2013 27 March 2002) was an Austria/Hungarian-born American filmmaker, screenwriter, producer, artist, and journalist, whose career spanned more than 50 years and 60 films. He is regarded as one of the most brilliant and versatile filmmakers of Hollywood's golden age. Wilder is one of only five people who have won Academy Awards as producer, director, and writer for the same film (The Apartment).\n\nWilder became a screenwriter in the late 1920s while living in Berlin. After the rise of Adolf Hitler, Wilder, who was Jewish, left for Paris, where he made his directorial debut. He relocated to Hollywood in 1933, and in 1939 he had a hit as a co-writer of the screenplay to the screwball comedy Ninotchka. Wilder established his directorial reputation after helming Double Indemnity (1944), a film noir he co-wrote with mystery novelist Raymond Chandler. Wilder earned the Best Director and Best Screenplay Academy Awards for the adaptation of a Charles R. Jackson story The Lost Weekend, about alcoholism. In 1950, Wilder co-wrote and directed the critically acclaimed Sunset Boulevard.\n\nFrom the mid-1950s on, Wilder made mostly comedies. Among the classics Wilder created in this period are the farces The Seven Year Itch (1955) and Some Like It Hot (1959), satires such as The Apartment (1960), and the romantic comedy Sabrina (1954). He directed fourteen different actors in Oscar-nominated performances. Wilder was recognized with the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1986. In 1988, Wilder was awarded the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award. In 1993, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts. Wilder holds a significant place in the history of Hollywood censorship for expanding the range of acceptable subject matter.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Billy Wilder, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He was nominated for the Academy Award as Best Director for 12 Angry Men (1957), Dog Day Afternoon (1975), Network (1976) and The Verdict (1982). He did not win an individual Academy Award, although he did receive an Academy Honorary Award and 14 of his films were nominated for various Oscars, such as Network, which was nominated for 10, winning 4.\n\nThe Encyclopedia of Hollywood states that Lumet was one of the most prolific directors of the modern era, making more than one movie per year on average since his directorial debut in 1957. He was noted by Turner Classic Movies for his \"strong direction of actors\", \"vigorous storytelling\" and the \"social realism\" in his best work. Film critic Roger Ebert described him as having been \"one of the finest craftsmen and warmest humanitarians among all film directors.\" Lumet was also known as an \"actor's director,\" having worked with the best of them during his career, probably more than \"any other director.\"\n\nLumet began his career as an Off-Broadway director, then became a highly efficient TV director. His first movie was typical of his best work: a well-acted, tightly written, deeply considered \"problem picture,\" 12 Angry Men (1957). From that point on Lumet divided his energies among other idealistic problem pictures along with literate adaptations of plays and novels, big stylish pictures, New York-based black comedies, and realistic crime dramas, including Serpico and Prince of the City. As a result of directing 12 Angry Men, he was also responsible for leading the first wave of directors who made a successful transition from TV to movies. In 2005, Lumet received an Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement for his \"brilliant services to screenwriters, performers, and the art of the motion picture.\" Two years later, he concluded his career with the acclaimed drama Before the Devil Knows You're Dead (2007).\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Sidney Lumet, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.\u200b",

In his movies, he is known for his acrobatic fighting style, comic timing, use of improvised weapons, and innovative stunts. Jackie Chan has been acting since the 1970s and has appeared in over 100 films.\n\nChan has received stars on the Hong Kong Avenue of Stars and the Hollywood Walk of Fame. As a cultural icon, Chan has been referenced in various pop songs, cartoons, and video games. Chan is also a Cantopop and Mandopop star, having released a number of albums and sung many of the theme songs for the films in which he has starred.\n\nChan was born on April 7, 1954, in Victoria Peak, in the former Crown colony of Hong Kong, as Chan Kong-sang (meaning \"born in Hong Kong\") to Charles and Lee-Lee Chan, refugees from the Chinese Civil War. He was nicknamed Paopao (Chinese: \u70ae\u70ae, literally meaning \"Cannonball\") because he was such a big baby, weighing 12 pounds, or about 5.4 kgs. Since his parents worked for the French Consul to Hong Kong, Chan spent his formative years within the grounds of the consul's residence in the Victoria Peak district. Chan attended the Nah-Hwa Primary School on Hong Kong Island, where he failed his first year, after which his parents withdrew him from the school.\n\nIn 1960, his father immigrated to Canberra, Australia, to work as the head cook for the American embassy, and Chan was sent to the China Drama Academy, a Peking Opera School run by Master Yu Jim-yuen. Chan trained rigorously for the next decade, excelling in martial arts and acrobatics. He eventually became part of the Seven Little Fortunes, a performance group made up of the school's best students, gaining the stage name Yuen Lo in homage to his master. Chan became close friends with fellow group members Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao, the three of them later to be known as the Three Brothers or Three Dragons. At the age of 17, he worked as a stuntman in the Bruce Lee films Fist of Fury and Enter the Dragon under the stage name Chan Yuen Lung. \u00a0\u00a0He received his first starring role later that year, in Little Tiger of Canton, which had a limited release in Hong Kong in 1973.",

After studying film in London, he became assistant director to Otto Preminger on Exodus (1960), Leon Uris's epic about the birth of Israel. Thereafter he worked on Zorba the Greek (1964), in which Cosmatos had a small part as Boy with Acne. Cosmatos grew up in Egypt and Cyprus and is said to have spoken six languages. He was famous in Italy for the movies Rappresaglia (1973) with Marcello Mastroianni and The Cassandra Crossing (1976) with Sophia Loren. In 1979, he made the famous and successful World War II adventure movie Escape to Athena, starring a gigantic all star cast including Roger Moore, David Niven, Telly Savalas, Elliot Gould and Claudia Cardinale. Cosmatos was nominated for a 1985 Golden Raspberry Award for his role as director of Rambo: First Blood Part II starring Sylvester Stallone. He also directed another Stallone vehicle, Cobra, in 1986.\n\nLate in his career, Cosmatos received more praise for Tombstone, a 1993 Western movie about Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp. This film was particularly praised for the exceptional performance of Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday. After his death it was revealed by Tombstone star Kurt Russell that Cosmatos had ghost-directed the movie on Russell's behalf. Sylvester Stallone recommended Cosmatos after the departure of the first director, and informed Russell that Cosmatos had also ghost-directed Rambo: First Blood Part II on Stallone's behalf.[1]\n\nGeorge P.

He bought his first camera at the age of 17 and made short films while studying animation at Cin\u00e9mation Studios. He befriended Marc Caro, a designer and comic book artist who became his longtime collaborator and co-director. They met at an animation festival in Annecy in 1974.\n\nTogether, Jeunet and Caro directed award-winning animations. Their first live action film was The Bunker of the Last Gunshots (1981), a short film about soldiers in a bleak futuristic world. Jeunet also directed numerous advertisements and music videos, such as Jean Michel Jarre's Zoolook (together with Caro).\n\nJeunet's films often resonate with the late twentieth century French film movement, cin\u00e9ma du look, and allude to themes and aesthetics involving German expressionism, French poetic realism, and the French New Wave.\n\nJeunet and Caro's first feature film was Delicatessen (1991), a melancholy comedy set in a famine-plagued post-apocalyptic world, in which an apartment building above a delicatessen is ruled by a butcher who kills people in order to feed his tenants.\n\nThey next made The City of Lost Children (1995), a dark, multi-layered fantasy film about a mad scientist who steals children's dreams so that he can live indefinitely.[3] The success of The City of Lost Children led to an invitation to direct the fourth film in the Alien series, Alien: Resurrection (1997). This is where Jeunet and Caro ended up going their separate ways as Jeunet believed this to be an amazing opportunity and Caro was not interested in a film that lacked creative control working on a big-budget Hollywood movie. Caro ended up assisting for a few weeks, with costumes and set design but afterwards, decided to work on a solo career in illustration and computer graphics.\n\nJeunet directed Am\u00e9lie (2001), starring Audrey Tautou. Am\u00e9lie is the story of a woman who takes pleasure in doing good deeds but has trouble finding love herself, was a huge critical and commercial success worldwide and was nominated for several Academy Awards. For this film, Jeunet also gained a European Film Award for Best Director.\n\nJeunet has also directed numerous commercials including a 2'25\" film for Chanel N\u00b0 5 featuring his frequent collaborator Audrey Tautou.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Jean-Pierre Jeunet, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He designed the three mechanical sharks for the movie Jaws (1975) with mechanical effects man Bob Mattey supervising their physical construction in Sun Valley CA. After the sharks were completed, they were trucked to the shooting location, but unfortunately they had not been tested in water causing a series of delays that have become quite legendary over time.\n\nHe was nominated for the Academy Award and won the BAFTA for Best Art Direction for his work on Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\n\nAlves worked on Jaws 2 (1978) in the capacity of both production designer and as second unit director. After John D. Hancock, the initial director of Jaws 2, was sacked, it was suggested that Alves co-direct it with Verna Fields (who edited the original Jaws). Jeannot Szwarc was hired, however, to complete the film.\n\nThe model of New York he created for John Carpenter's Escape from New York (1981) has been described as \"memorably derelict\", and he was visual consultant on Carpenter's Starman (1984).",

He was noted for his ability to work across a range of genres and an aptitude for getting the best out of actors regardless of their acting experience. \n\nNichols began his career in the 1950s with the comedy improvisational troupe, The Compass Players, predecessor of The Second City, in Chicago. He then teamed up with his improv partner, Elaine May, to form the comedy duo Nichols and May. Their live improv acts were a hit on Broadway resulting in three albums, with their debut album winning a Grammy Award.\n\nAfter Nichols and May disbanded their act in 1961, Nichols began directing plays. He soon earned a reputation as a skilled Broadway director with a flair for creating innovative productions and the ability to elicit polished performances from actors. His debut Broadway play was Neil Simon's Barefoot in the Park in 1963, with Robert Redford and Elizabeth Ashley. He next directed Luv in 1964 and in 1965 directed another Neil Simon play, The Odd Couple. Nichols received a Tony Award for each of those plays. Nearly five decades later, he won his sixth Tony Award as best director with a revival of Death of a Salesman in 2012. During his career, he directed or produced over twenty-five Broadway plays.\n\nIn 1966, Warner Brothers invited Nichols to direct his first film, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. The groundbreaking and acclaimed film led critics to declare Nichols the \"new Orson Welles\". The film garnered 13 Academy Award nominations, winning five. It was also a box office hit and became the number 1 film of 1966. His next film was The Graduate in 1967, starring then unknown actor Dustin Hoffman, alongside Anne Bancroft and Katharine Ross. The film was another critical and financial success, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1967 and receiving seven Academy Award nominations, winning Nichols the Academy Award for Best Directing. Among the other films he directed were Catch-22 (1970), Carnal Knowledge (1971), Silkwood (1983), Working Girl (1988), Wolf (1994), The Birdcage (1996), Closer (2004), and Charlie Wilson's War (2007).\n\nAlong with an Academy Award, Nichols won a Grammy Award (the first for a comedian born outside the United States), four Emmy Awards and nine Tony Awards. He was also a three-time BAFTA Award winner. His other honors included the Lincoln Center Gala Tribute in 1999, the National Medal of Arts in 2001, the Kennedy Center Honors in 2003 and the AFI Life Achievement Award in 2010. His films garnered a total of 42 Academy Award nominations and seven wins.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Mike Nichols, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Noted for his innovative dramatic productions as well as his distinctive voice and personality, Welles is widely acknowledged as one of the most accomplished dramatic artists of the twentieth century, especially for his significant and influential early work\u2014despite his notoriously contentious relationship with Hollywood. His distinctive directorial style featured layered, nonlinear narrative forms, innovative uses of lighting such as chiaroscuro, unique camera angles, sound techniques borrowed from radio, deep focus shots, and long takes. Welles's long career in film is noted for his struggle for artistic control in the face of pressure from studios. Many of his films were heavily edited and others left unreleased. He has been praised as a major creative force and as \"the ultimate auteur.\"\n\nAfter directing a number of high-profile theatrical productions in his early twenties, including an innovative adaptation of Macbeth and The Cradle Will Rock, Welles found national and international fame as the director and narrator of a 1938 radio adaptation of H. G. Wells's novel The War of the Worlds performed for the radio drama anthology series Mercury Theatre on the Air. It was reported to have caused widespread panic when listeners thought that an invasion by extraterrestrial beings was occurring. Although these reports of panic were mostly false and overstated,[2] they rocketed Welles to instant notoriety.\n\nCitizen Kane (1941), his first film with RKO, in which he starred in the role of Charles Foster Kane, is often considered the greatest film ever made. Several of his other films, including The Magnificent Ambersons (1942), The Lady from Shanghai (1947), Touch of Evil (1958), Chimes at Midnight (1965), and F for Fake (1974), are also widely considered to be masterpieces.\n\nIn 2002, he was voted the greatest film director of all time in two separate British Film Institute polls among directors and critics, and a wide survey of critical consensus, best-of lists, and historical retrospectives calls him the most acclaimed director of all time. Well known for his baritone voice, Welles was also an extremely well regarded actor and was voted number 16 in AFI's 100 Years... 100 Stars list of the greatest American film actors of all time. He was also a celebrated Shakespearean stage actor and an accomplished magician, starring in troop variety shows in the war years.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Orson Welles, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

After landing a job as a staff writer on the final season of Da Ali G Show, for which Rogen and the other writers received an Emmy nomination, he was guided by film producer Judd Apatow toward a film career. Rogen was cast in a major supporting role and credited as a co-producer in Apatow's directorial debut, The 40-Year-Old Virgin.\u00a0\n\nAfter receiving critical praise for that performance, Universal Pictures agreed to cast him as the lead in Apatow's next directorial feature, Knocked Up.\n\nRogen has appeared in the films Donnie Darko, You, Me and Dupree, Zack and Miri Make a Porno, Observe and Report, and The Green Hornet, and also in the Apatow-produced comedies The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Superbad, Pineapple Express, and Funny People. He and his comedy partner Evan Goldberg co-wrote the comedy films Superbad and Pineapple Express, for which he originally intended to headline while in high school. Rogen has provided voice talents in the animated films Horton Hears a Who!, Kung Fu Panda, and Monsters vs. Aliens. He also supports Crowdrise, a charitable networking site.",

He founded nWave Pictures in 1994, producing highly successful CGI ride films including the groundbreaking Devils Mine. Starting in 1997, Ben Stassen began focusing on large format films usually screened at IMAX theaters, and made some of the most successful large format films to date, including Thrill Ride: The Science of Fun and Alien Adventure. Contrary to most large format films, which mix education with spectacular visuals, most of Stassen's films are aimed exclusively at the entertainment market. As IMAX theaters around the world increasingly became capable of screening stereoscopic (3-D) films in the late nineties, Stassen quickly embraced this new technology, and directed a succession of popular 3-D large format films, such as Encounter in the Third Dimension and Haunted Castle. Upon screening \"Haunted Castle\", Imax corporation sent a fax to all the exhibitors warning them about the content of the film. Imax went as far as labeling \"Haunted Castle\" as degrading to the brand. This triggered a strong reaction from both the exhibitors and the press. The film was marketed as \"The film Imax corporation does not want you to see\". It went on the become a huge success worldwide.\n\nIn 2004, Stassen produced and directed \"Wild Safari\", the first 3D wildlife film for the giant screen (Imax).\n\nnWave is also the leading producer and distributor of 3D ride films and 4D attraction films with over 30 titles in their library. Over 200,000 people a day see one of nWave's films in theme parks, science centers, zoo, aquaria and musea around the world.\n\nBen Stassen's first feature length animated film, Fly Me to the Moon, was released in North America on 15 August 2008 on both regular size and IMAX screens, exclusively in 3-D. According to nWave, Fly Me to the Moon was the first animated film to be designed, created, and released solely in 3-D. The film was originally announced for the spring or summer of 2007. The delay is believed to be the result of the slow roll-out of 3-D projection technology.\n\nOn 7 May 2008, nWave announced that its next feature length animated film would be titled Around the World in 50 Years and that it too would be directed by Ben Stassen. It was released in 2010 titled Sammy's Adventures: The Secret Passage.\n\nStassen was also involved in the production of several movies directed by famed Croatian film director Krsto Papi\u0107, most notably \"My Uncle's Legacy\" (\u017divot sa stricem), the film was nominated for a Golden Globe (Best Foreign Film category) in 1990.\n\nStassen is widely quoted as a leading pioneer of 3D cinema, considering 3D as the 2nd revolution in the history of cinema, second only to the transition from silent film to the talkies. He mostly refers to American 3D film as 2.5 D cinema. In his opinion most filmmakers do not make any effort to use 3D as a new language of cinema. They simply shoot their 2D films with two cameras creating a little depth behind the screen with the odd in-your-face effect. He is also quite outspoken about the inadequacies of the 3D digital theaters. The essence of 3D cinema is its ability to greatly enhance the sense of immersion in the story being told. But there is no way to achieve real immersion unless you have floor-to-ceiling and wall-to-wall screens. The image must fill you field of vision as much as possible. The long term viability of 3D cinema will depend on the exhibitors willingness to build theaters designed specifically for 3D immersion.\n\nnWave Pictures is currently producing two 3D features. The sequel to Sammy's Adventures (\"Escape From Paradise\") and African Safari 3D, a live action 3D adventure documentary taking the audience from the cost of Skeleton Coast in Namibia to the top of the Kilimanjaro.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Ben Stassen, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia .",

        "biography": "\u200bFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. \u00a0\n\nKarl W. Freund, A.S.C. (January 16, 1890-May 3, 1969) was a cinematographer and film director. Born in Dv\u016fr Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 (K\u00f6niginhof), Bohemia, his career began in 1905 when, at age 15, he got a job as an assistant projectionist for a film company in Berlin where his family moved in 1901. He worked as a cinematographer on over 100 films, including the German Expressionist films The Golem (1920), The Last Laugh (1924) and Metropolis (1927). Freund emigrated to the United States in 1929 where he continued to shoot well remembered films such as Dracula (1931) and Key Largo (1948). He won an Academy Award for Best Cinematography for The Good Earth (1937). In 1937, he went to Germany to bring his only daughter, Gerda Maria Freund, back to the United States, saving her from almost certain death in the concentration camps. Karl's ex-wife, Susette Freund (n\u00e9e Liepmannssohn), remained in Germany where she was interned at the Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp and eventually taken in March, 1942 to Bernburg Euthanasia Center where she was murdered. Between 1921 and 1935, Freund also directed ten films, of which the best known are probably The Mummy (1932) starring Boris Karloff, and his last film as director, Mad Love (1935) starring Peter Lorre. Freund's only known film as an actor is Carl Dreyer's Michael (1924) in which he has a cameo as a sycophantic art dealer who saves the tobacco ashes dropped by a famous painter. At the beginning of the 1950s, he was persuaded by Desi Arnaz at Desilu to be the cinematographer in 1951 for the televisions series I Love Lucy. Critics have credited Freund for the show's lustrous black and white cinematography, but more importantly, Freund designed the \"flat lighting\" system for shooting sitcoms that is still in use today. This system covers the set in light, thus eliminating shadows and allowing the use of three moving cameras without having to modify the lighting in-between shots. And where Freund did not invent the three camera shooting system, he did perfect it for use with film cameras in front of a live audience. Freund and his production team also worked on other sitcoms produced at/through Desilu such as \"Our Miss Brooks\".\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Karl Freund, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nAnne Fontaine (born in Luxembourg, 1959) is a filmmaker and screenwriter who used to be an actor. She lives and works in France.\n\nBorn Fontaine Sibertin-Blanc, sister of actor Jean-Chr\u00e9tien Sibertin-Blanc, she went as a young child to live in Lisbon, where her father, Antoine Sibertin-Blanc, is a music professor and cathedral organist. In adolescence she moved to Paris and trained in dance with Joseph Russillo while continuing her academic education, including philosophy. Her husband is Philippe Carcassonne, the film producer, and they have an adopted son who was born in Vietnam.\n\nWhile still dancing, she was picked by Robert Hossein to play Esmeralda in a 1980 theatrical production of The Hunchback of Notre Dame and around this time started to use the name Anne Fontaine. She continued with acting and became known for her roles in comedies like Si ma gueule vous pla\u00eet... (1981) and P.R.O.F.S.(1985). An opportunity to be assistant director came with a 1986 stage version of C\u00e9line's Voyage au bout de la nuit (Journey to the End of the Night) at the Renaud-Barrault theatre.\n\nFontaine's first project as solo director, Les histoires d'amour finissent mal... en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral (Love Affairs Usually End Badly), won the 1993 Prix Jean Vigo (prize). In 1995, she worked with her brother on the comic Augustin. Two years later, she wrote and directed the successful Nettoyage \u00e0 Sec (Dry Cleaning). This won the Best Screenplay award at the Venice Film Festival 1997 and is generally considered a milestone on Fontaine's way to becoming \"an important figure in contemporary French cinema\".\n\nIn 1999 the character Augustin (Jean-Chr\u00e9tien Sibertin-Blanc) re-appeared in Fontaine's film Augustin, Roi Du Kung-Fu (Augustin, King of Kung-Fu). Comment j'ai tu\u00e9 mon p\u00e8re (How I Killed My Father) was released in 2001, and Nathalie... followed in 2003. The 2005 film, Entre Ses Mains (In His Hands) has been widely described as a thriller: an \"intimate thriller\" according to Fontaine herself.

Then came La fille de Monaco (The Girl From Monaco) in 2008 and Coco avant Chanel (Coco Before Chanel), her biopic of Coco Chanel, in 2009.\n\nFontaine's work is not easily categorised, though the phrase \"psychological drama\" is often used. She told a UK newspaper, \"I try to work on my characters' blind side, in a kind of Freudian way: to ask, 'What are the things about themselves that they're unaware of?' I'm fascinated by the irony of fate, when something goes into a skid. All my stories have an element of cruelty in them.\"\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Anne Fontaine (filmmaker), licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "William Friedkin is an American film director, producer and screenwriter best known for directing The French Connection in 1971 and The Exorcist in 1973; for the former, he won the Academy Award for Best Director. Some of his other films include Sorcerer, Cruising, To Live and Die in L.A., Jade, Rules of Engagement, The Hunted, Bug, and Killer Joe.\n\nAs mentioned in Friedkin's voice-over commentary on the DVD re-release of Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo, Friedkin directed one of the last episodes of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour in 1965, called \"Off Season\". Hitchcock admonished Friedkin for not wearing a tie while directing.\n\nIn 1965 Friedkin moved to Hollywood and two years later released his first feature film, Good Times starring Sonny and Cher. Several other \"art\" films followed, including the adaptation of Mart Crowley's The Boys in the Band and most notably The Birthday Party, based on an unpublished screenplay by Harold Pinter, which he adapted from his own play. Friedkin, however, did not want to be known as an art house director, but rather for action and serious drama through stories about an America upended by crime, hypocrisy, the occult, and amorality. All of which he mounted up into his films to reflect what was going on in an America that was changing in the wake of Vietnam, the Sexual Revolution, and Watergate.\n\nIn 1971, his The French Connection was released to wide critical acclaim. Shot in a gritty style more suited for documentaries than Hollywood features, the film won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. Friedkin followed up with 1973's The Exorcist, based on William Peter Blatty's best-selling novel, which revolutionized the horror genre and is considered by some critics to be one of the greatest horror movies of all time. The Exorcist was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. It won the Best Screenplay and Best Sound Mixing.\n\nFollowing these two pictures, Friedkin, along with Francis Ford Coppola and Peter Bogdanovich, was deemed one of the premier directors of New Hollywood; In 1973 the trio announced the formation of an independent production company at Paramount, The Directors Company. Whereas Coppola directed The Conversation and Bogdanovich, the Henry James adaptation, Daisy Miller, Friedkin abruptly left the company, which was soon closed by Paramount. \n\nFriedkin's later movies did not achieve the same success. \n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, Friedkin's films received mostly lackluster reviews and moderate ticket sales. However, his action/crime movie To Live and Die in L.A. (1985), starring William Petersen and Willem Dafoe, was a critical favorite and drew comparisons to Friedkin's own The French Connection (particularly for its car-chase sequence). In 2011 Friedkin directed Killer Joe, a black comedy written by Tracy Letts, and starring Matthew McConaughey. Killer Joe premiered at the 68th Venice International Film Festival, prior to its North American debut at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival. \n\nIn April 2013 Friedkin published a memoir, The Friedkin Connection. He was presented with a lifetime achievement award at the 70th Venice International Film Festival in September.",

He was known for the innovative and explicit depiction of action and violence, as well as his revisionist approach to the Western genre.\n\nPeckinpah's films generally deal with the conflict between values and ideals, and the corruption of violence in human society. He was given the nickname \"Bloody Sam\" owing to the violence in his films. His characters are often loners or losers who desire to be honorable, but are forced to compromise in order to survive in a world of nihilism and brutality.\n\nPeckinpah's combative personality, marked by years of alcohol and drug abuse, has often overshadowed his professional legacy. Many of his films were noted for behind-the-scenes battles with producers and crew members, damaging his reputation and career during his lifetime.

He wrote the latter's sequel, and most recently wrote and directed Starship Troopers 3: Marauder.\n\nNeumeier studied journalism at the University of California at Santa Cruz then attended the School of Motion Picture and Television at University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). After completing his bachelor's degree at UCLA, Newmeier started work in the Hollywood film business, as a production assistant on the TV series Taxi, a proof-reader for Paramount Pictures and Columbia Pictures; and as a junior executive at the Universal Pictures company.\n\nNeumeier wrote his first outlines and film treatments for his first movie, RoboCop, as well as \"spec\" scripts. He declined an offer of a vice-presidency at Universal Pictures, to develop the screenplay for RoboCop, with Michael Miner.\n\nThe rights to the screenplay were bought up by the Orion Pictures company, and was granted a budget of just under $15 million. Paul Verhoeven was assigned to make the movie.\n\nNeumeier also co-produced RoboCop, which was released in movie theaters in 1987 in North America and some other locations. This movie was a success, and it drew just over 50 million dollars' worth of ticket sales in the United States, alone. The success of RoboCop also motivated the production of two sequels, RoboCop 2 and RoboCop 3, and also two TV series, one live-action and one animated. Most of the creators of RoboCop had left before the production of these sequels.\n\nThe first sequel to RoboCop, RoboCop 2, was planned to have its screenplay written by Neumeier. He had written a first draft of a screenplay for RoboCop 2, when a screenwriters' strike occurred. It prevented Neumeier from writing any more of the screenplay. The Orion Pictures company next decided to hire the comic book artist Frank Miller to work on his own screenplay for RoboCop 2.\n\nA decade after the first RoboCop movie was produced, Neumeier rejoined Paul Verhoeven to work on Starship Troopers, which was adapted from the novel with the same name by Robert A. Heinlein in 1959. With violence and satire thrown into a story of efforts by the human race to insure its survival (in ways similar to RoboCop at times, Starship Troopers seemed to have been more successful in Europe, Asia, etc., than in North America where it drew gross ticket sales of about $54 million at theaters, although Artforum magazine selected this film as one of the \"10 most artistic [film] achievements of 1997\". Neumeier also appeared in this film in the brief role of a man convicted of murder and sentenced to immediate execution.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Edward Neumeier, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Picture for To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), Best Director for All the President's Men (1976) and Best Adapted Screenplay for Sophie's Choice (1982).\n\nPakula was also notable for directing his \"paranoia trilogy\": All the President's Men, Klute (1971), and The Parallax View (1974).\n\nPakula started his Hollywood career as an assistant in the cartoon department at Warner Brothers. In 1957, he undertook his first production role for Paramount Pictures. In 1962, he produced To Kill a Mockingbird, for which he was nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award. Pakula had a successful professional relationship as the producer of movies directed by Robert Mulligan from 1957 to 1968. In 1969, he directed his first feature, The Sterile Cuckoo, starring Liza Minnelli.\n\nIn 1971, Pakula released the first installment of what would informally come to be known as his \"paranoia trilogy\". Klute, the story of a relationship between a private eye (played by Donald Sutherland) and a call girl (played by Jane Fonda, who won an Oscar for her performance), was a commercial and critical success. This was followed in 1974 by The Parallax View starring Warren Beatty, a labyrinthine post-Watergate thriller involving political assassinations. The film has been noted for its experimental use of hypnotic imagery in a celebrated film-within-a-film sequence in which the protagonist is inducted into the Parallax Corporation, whose main, albeit non-ostensible, enterprise is domestic terrorism.\n\nFinally, in 1976, Pakula rounded out the \"trilogy\" with All the President's Men, based on the bestselling account of the Watergate scandal written by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who were played in the movie by Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman, respectively. It was another commercial hit, considered by many critics and fans to be one of the best thrillers of the 1970s.\n\nPakula scored another hit in 1982 with Sophie's Choice, starring Meryl Streep. His screenplay, based on the novel by William Styron, was nominated for an Academy Award. Later commercial successes included Presumed Innocent, based on the bestselling novel by Scott Turow, and another political thriller, The Pelican Brief, an adaptation of John Grisham's bestseller. His final film was the crime drama thriller film The Devil's Own, where he reunited with Harrison Ford.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Alan J.

The film focuses on a man, played by Hayes, who fixates on another man whose sexuality he doesn't know, played by Brad Rowe. Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss played in competition at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival. It is credited with helping Hayes win a role on the long running TV series Will and Grace. Get Over It starred Kirsten Dunst, Ben Foster, Mila Kunis and Zoe Saldana in a teen comedy about a school theater production. O'Haver's third film Ella Enchanted, features Anne Hathaway, in a modern take on the princess fairy tale.

He won an Academy Award for Best Director for Midnight Cowboy, and was nominated for two other films (Darling and Sunday Bloody Sunday).\n\nSchlesinger was born in London, into a middle class Jewish family. His acting career began in the 1950s and consisted of supporting roles in British films and television productions. He began his directorial career in 1956 with the short documentary Sunday in the Park about London's Hyde Park. In 1958, Schlesinger created a documentary on Benjamin Britten and the Aldeburgh Festival for the BBC's Monitor TV programme, including rehearsals of the children's opera Noye's Fludde featuring a young Michael Crawford.\n\nBy the 1960s, he had virtually given up acting to concentrate on a directing career, and another of his earlier directorial efforts, the British Transport Films' documentary Terminus (1961), gained a Venice Film Festival Gold Lion and a British Academy Award. His first two fiction films, A Kind of Loving (1962) and Billy Liar (1963) were set in the North of England. A Kind of Loving won the Golden Bear award at the 12th Berlinale in 1962. His third feature film, Darling (1965), tartly described the modern, urban way of life in London and was one of the first films about 'swinging London'. Schlesinger's next film was the period drama Far from the Madding Crowd (1967), an adaptation of Thomas Hardy's popular novel accentuated by beautiful English country locations. Both films (and Billy Liar) featured Julie Christie as the female lead.\n\nSchlesinger's next film, Midnight Cowboy (1969), was internationally acclaimed. A story of two hustlers living on the fringe in the bad side of New York City, it was Schlesinger's first film shot in the US, and it won Oscars for Best Director and Best Picture. During the 1970s, he made an array of films that were mainly about loners, losers and people outside the clean world, such as Sunday Bloody Sunday (1971), The Day of the Locust (1975), Marathon Man (1976) and Yanks (1979). Later, came the major box office and critical failure of Honky Tonk Freeway (1981), followed by films that attracted mixed responses from the public\n\nFrom 1973, he was an associate director of the Royal National Theatre, where he produced George Bernard Shaw's Heartbreak House (1975). He also directed several operas, beginning with Les contes d'Hoffmann (1980) and Der Rosenkavalier (1984), both at Covent Garden. \n\nSchlesinger was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his services to film in 1970. In 2003, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article John Schlesinger, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

His films utilize unconventional storytelling methods, such as long takes and/or non-professional actors to achieve realism.\n\nDebuting with his film Family Nest in 1979, Tarr underwent a period of what he refers to as \"social cinema\", aimed at telling mundane stories about ordinary people, often in the style of cinema v\u00e9rit\u00e9. Over the next decade, the cinematography of Tarr's films gradually changed; Damnation (1988) was shot with languid camera movement aimed at establishing ambience. It marked Tarr's earliest experimentation with philosophical themes, focused mostly on bleak and desolate representations of reality. S\u00e1t\u00e1ntang\u00f3 (1994) and Werckmeister Harmonies (2000) continued this approach; both are considered by some critics to be among the greatest films ever made. Tarr would later compete in the 2007 Cannes Film Festival with his film The Man From London.\n\nFrequent collaborators of Tarr include his wife \u00c1gnes Hranitzky, novelist L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Krasznahorkai, film composer Mih\u00e1ly V\u00edg, cinematographer Fred Kelemen, and actress Erika B\u00f3k.

Within the film industry, he was considered a maverick for taking risks and thereby creating unique films, with many of his stories being dramas about lone and principled individuals tested by tragic events. According to one historian, Zinnemann's style demonstrated his sense of \"psychological realism and his apparent determination to make worthwhile pictures that are nevertheless highly entertaining.\"\n\nSome of his most notable films were The Men (1950), High Noon (1952), From Here to Eternity (1953), Oklahoma!

        "biography": "Spike Lee was born Shelton Lee in 1957, in Atlanta, Georgia. At a very young age, he moved from pre-civil rights Georgia, to Brooklyn, New York. Lee came from a proud and intelligent background. His father was a jazz musician, and his mother, a school teacher. His mother dubbed him Spike, due to his tough nature. He attended school in Morehouse College in Atlanta and developed his film making skills at Clark Atlanta University. After graduating, he went to the Tisch School of Arts graduate film program. He made a controversial short, The Answer (1980), a reworking of D.W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation (1915) -- a ten-minute film. Lee went on to produce a 45-minute film Joe's Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads (1983), which won a student academy award. Lee's next film, \"The Messenger,\" in 1984, was somewhat biographical. In 1986, Spike Lee made the film, She's Gotta Have It (1986), a comedy about sexual relationships. The movie was made for 175,000 dollars, and made seven million. Since then, Lee has become a well-known, intelligent, and talented film maker. His next movie was School Daze (1988), which was set in a historically black school and focused mostly on the conflict between the school and the Fraternities, of which he was a strong critic, portraying them as materialistic, irresponsible, and uncaring. Lee went on to do his landmark film, Do the Right Thing (1989), a movie specifically about his own town in Brooklyn, New York. The movie portrayed a neighborhood on a very hot day, and the racial tensions that emerge. The movie garnered an Oscar nomination, for Danny Aiello, for supporting actor. It also sparked a debate on racial relations. Lee went on to produce the jazz biopic Mo' Better Blues (1990) which showed his talent for directing and acting, and was the first of many Spike Lee films to feature Denzel Washington. His next film, Jungle Fever (1991), was about interracial dating. Lee's handling of the subject proved yet again highly controversial. Lee's next film was the self-titled biography of Malcolm X (1992), which had Denzel Washington portraying the civil rights leader. The movie was a success, and resulted in an Oscar nomination for Washington. His next films were the comparatively light, Crooklyn (1994), and the intense crime drama, Clockers (1995). In 1996, Lee directed two movies: the badly received comedy, Girl 6 (1996), and the politically pointed, Get on the Bus (1996), about a group of men going to the Million Man March. His next film, He Got Game (1998), proved to be another excursion into the collegiate world as he shows the darker side of recruiting college athletes. The movie, in limited release, yet again featured Denzel Washington. In 2000 came Bamboozled which made a mockery out of television and the way African-Americans are perceived by white America and the way African-Americans perceive themselves. The movie, however, was a resounding critical success. Lee also has produced films like New Jersey Drive (1995), Tales from the Hood (1995), and Drop Squad (1994). He also has produced and or directed movies about Huey P. Newton, Jim Brown, and has commented in many documentaries about varied subjects. With pointed political messages, insightful, different and intelligent films, Spike Lee has become a well known political presence. He looks likely to have further success in the film business. Lee is an obsessive New York Knicks fan. He and his wife, Tonya Lewis Lee, have two children.",

He won Academy Awards as Best Director for The Sound of Music (1965) and West Side Story (1961) as well as nominations as Best Film Editing for Citizen Kane (1941) and Best Picture for The Sand Pebbles (1966).\n\nAmong his other films are Born to Kill; Destination Gobi; The Hindenburg; Star Trek: The Motion Picture; The Day the Earth Stood Still; Run Silent, Run Deep; The Andromeda Strain; The Set-Up; The Haunting; and The Body Snatcher. Wise's working period spanned the 1930s to the 1990s.\n\nOften contrasted with contemporary \"auteur\" directors such as Stanley Kubrick who tended to bring a distinctive directorial \"look\" to a particular genre, Wise is famously viewed to have allowed his (sometimes studio assigned) story to dictate style. Later critics such as Martin Scorsese would go on to expand that characterization, insisting that despite Wise's notorious workaday concentration on stylistic perfection within the confines of genre and budget, his choice of subject matter and approach still functioned to identify Wise as an artist and not merely an artisan. Through whatever means, Wise's approach would bring him critical success as a director in many different traditional film genres: from horror to noir to Western to war films to science fiction, to musical and drama, with many repeat hits within each genre. Wise's tendency towards professionalism led to a degree of preparedness which, though nominally motivated by studio budget constraints, nevertheless advanced the moviemaking art, with many Academy Award-winning films the result. Robert Wise received the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1998.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Robert Wise, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "Roman Polanski (born 18 August 1933) is a Polish-French film director, producer, writer and actor. Born in Paris to Polish parents, Polanski relocated with his family to Poland in 1937. After surviving the Holocaust, he continued his education in Poland and became a critically acclaimed director of both art house and commercial films. Polanski's first feature-length film, Knife in the Water (1962), made in Poland, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. He has since received five more Oscar nominations, and in 2002 received the Academy Award for Best Director for his film, The Pianist. He has also been the recipient of two Baftas, four C\u00e9sars, a Golden Globe and the Palme d'Or. He left Poland in 1961 to live in France for several years, then moved to the United Kingdom where he collaborated with G\u00e9rard Brach on three films, beginning with Repulsion (1965). In 1968 he moved to the United States, immediately cementing his burgeoning directing status with the 1968 groundbreaking Academy Award winning horror film Rosemary's Baby.\n\nIn 1969, Polanski's pregnant wife, Sharon Tate, was murdered while staying at the Polanski's Benedict Canyon home above Los Angeles by members of the Manson Family. Following Tate's death, Polanski returned to Europe and spent much of his time in Paris and Gstaad, but did not make another film until he filmed Macbeth (1971) in England. The following year he went to Italy to make What? (1973) and subsequently spent the next five years living near Rome. However, he traveled to Hollywood to direct Chinatown (1974) for Paramount Pictures, with Robert Evans serving as producer. The film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards, and was a critical and box-office success; the script by Robert Towne won for Best Original Screenplay. Polanski's next film, The Tenant (1976), was shot in France, and completed the \"Apartment Trilogy\", following Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby.\n\nIn 1977, after a photo shoot in Los Angeles, Polanski was arrested for the sexual abuse of a 13 year old girl. He was charged with rape but pleaded guilty to unlawful sex with a minor. To avoid sentencing, Polanski fled to his home in London, and then moved on to France the following day. He has had a U.S. arrest warrant outstanding since then, and an international arrest warrant since 2005.\n\nPolanski continued to make films such as The Pianist (2002), a World War II-set adaptation of Jewish-Polish musician W\u0142adys\u0142aw Szpilman's autobiography of the same name, which echoed some of Polanski's earlier life experiences. Like Szpilman, Polanski escaped the ghetto and the concentration camps while family members were killed. The film won three Academy Awards including Best Director, the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or, and seven French C\u00e9sar Awards including Best Picture and Best Director. He then released the successful films Oliver Twist (2005), To Each His Own Cinema (2007), and The Ghost Writer (2010), completed while under house arrest.\n\nIn September 2009, Polanski was arrested by Swiss police, at the request of U.S. authorities, when he traveled to receive a lifetime achievement award at the Zurich Film Festival.In October 2009, the U.S. requested his extradition; however, on July 12, 2010, the Swiss rejected that request and instead declared him a \"free man\" after releasing him from custody.",

He studied theatre at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and studied further at the Camberwell School of Art and the Central School of Art and Design. He began as a theatre director and playwright in the mid 1960s. In the 1970s and 1980s his career moved between work for the theatre and making films for BBC Television, many of which were characterized by a gritty \"kitchen sink realism\" style. His well-known films include Life is Sweet (1990), the comedy-drama Career Girls (1997), the Gilbert and Sullivan biopic Topsy Turvy (1999), and the bleak working-class drama All or Nothing (2002). His most notable works are arguably Naked (1993) for which he won the Best Director Award at Cannes, the BAFTA-winning (and Oscar-nominated) Palme d'Or winner Secrets & Lies (1996) and Golden Lion winner Vera Drake (2004).\n\nHis films and stage plays, according to the critic Michael Coveney, \"comprise a distinctive, homogenous body of work which stands comparison with anyone's in the British theatre and cinema over the same period.\"\u00a0 Coveney further noted Leigh's role in helping to create stars \u2013 Liz Smith in Hard Labour, Alison Steadman in Abigail's Party, Brenda Blethyn in Grown-Ups, Antony Sher in Goose-Pimples, Gary Oldman and Tim Roth in Meantime, Jane Horrocks in Life is Sweet, David Thewlis in Naked \u2013 and remarked that the list of actors who have worked with him over the years \u2013 including Sheila Kelley, Paul Jesson, Phil Daniels, Lindsay Duncan, Lesley Sharp, Kathy Burke, Stephen Rea, Eric Richard, Julie Walters \u2013 \"comprises an impressive, almost representative, nucleus of outstanding British acting talent.\"\u00a0 Ian Buruma, writing in the New York Review of Books in January 1994, noted: \"It is hard to get on a London bus or listen to the people at the next table in a cafeteria without thinking of Mike Leigh. Like other wholly original artists, he has staked out his own territory. Leigh's London is as distinctive as Fellini's Rome or Ozu's Tokyo.\"\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Mike Leigh, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Neumann came to the US in the early talkie era, hired to direct German language versions of Hollywood films.\n\nOnce he mastered English and established himself as technically proficient in filmmaking, Neumann directed such low-budget programmers as The Big Cage (1932), Secret of the Blue Room (1933) with Paul Lukas and Gloria Stuart, Hold 'Em Navy (1936), It Happened in New Orleans (1936) with child star Bobby Breen, Wide Open Faces (1937) with Joe E. Brown, and Ellery Queen: Master Detective (1939).\n\nNeumann was signed by producer Hal Roach in 1941 to direct a series of \"streamliners\", 45-minute features designed to fill out short double bills. Among these 4-reel comedies were About Face (1942), Brooklyn Orchid (1942), Taxi, Mister? (1943) and Yanks Ahoy (1943).\n\nIn 1945, he joined the company of producer Sol Lesser, who engaged Neumann as coproducer and principal director of the Tarzan series produced by Lesser 1945-1954. The Tarzan films were produced for RKO and starred Johnny Weissmuller and later Gordon Scott.\n\nNeumann became known as a specialist in science fiction movies due to his producing and directing such productions as Rocketship X-M (1950) and The Fly (1958). Neumann directed other sci-fi and horror films such as Kronos (1957) and She-Devil (1957), and directed non-scifi films such as The Ring (1952) an independent feature co-starring Rita Moreno, Carnival Story (1954), Mohawk (1956), and The Deerslayer (1957)\n\nContrary to some published reports, Neumann did not die as a result of suicide, but, rather, from natural causes in Los Angeles on 21 August 1958, shortly after a preview screening of The Fly but before the official premiere. Thus, Neumann never knew what a boxoffice hit The Fly was. He was entombed at Utter McKinley Cemetery in Los Angeles.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Kurt Neumann (director), licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

Crowe has made his mark with character-driven, personal films that have been generally hailed as refreshingly original and devoid of cynicism. Michael Walker in The New York Times called Crowe \"something of a cinematic spokesman for the post-baby boom generation\" because his first few films focused on that specific age group, first as highers and then as young adults making their way in the world.\n\nCrowe's debut screenwriting effort, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, grew out of a book he wrote while posing for one year undercover as a student at Clairemont High School in San Diego, California, where he met Geraldine Edwards, who was a student there, and who he later based his Penny Lane character on in Almost Famous, when he discovered she was going backstage to rock and roll concerts. Later, he wrote and directed one more high school saga, Say Anything, and then Singles, a story of Seattle twentysomethings that was woven together by a soundtrack centering on that city's burgeoning grunge music scene.\n\nCrowe landed his biggest hit, though, with Jerry Maguire. After this, he was given a green light to go ahead with a pet project, the autobiographical effort Almost Famous. Centering on a teenage music journalist on tour with an up-and-coming band, it gave insight to his life as a 15-year-old writer for Rolling Stone. Crowe has stated that the Penny Lane character was based on his fellow San Diegan, Geraldine Edwards, who he met in 1975, as mentioned earlier. Part of the dialogue is also inspired by comments that were made by Bebe Buell in certain interviews. Also, in late 1999, Crowe released his second book, Conversations with Billy Wilder, a question and answer session with the legendary director.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Cameron Crowe, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

In 1953, he served in the United States Army. In 1965, he made his first appearance in the rejected Star Trek pilot, \"The Cage\", and would go on to play the character of Mr. Spock until 1969, followed by seven further films and a number of guest slots in various sequels. His character of Spock generated a significant cultural impact and three Emmy Award nominations; TV Guide named Spock one of the 50 greatest TV characters. Nimoy also had a recurring role in Mission: Impossible and a narrating role in Civilization IV, as well as several well-received stage appearances. Nimoy's fame as Spock is such that both his autobiographies, I Am Not Spock (1977) and I Am Spock (1995) detail his existence as being shared between the character and himself.\n\nNimoy was born to Yiddish-speaking Orthodox Jewish immigrants from Iziaslav, Ukraine. His father, Max Nimoy, owned a barbershop in the Mattapan section of the city. His mother, Dora Nimoy (n\u00e9e Spinner), was a homemaker. Nimoy began acting at the age of eight in children's and neighborhood theater. His parents wanted him to attend college and pursue a stable career, or even learn to play the accordion\u2014which, his father advised, Nimoy could always make a living with\u2014but his grandfather encouraged him to become an actor. His first major role was at 17, as Ralphie in an amateur production of Clifford Odets' Awake and Sing!. Nimoy took Drama classes at Boston College in 1953 but failed to complete his studies, and in the 1970s studied photography at the University of California, Los Angeles.

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nJohn Frederick Milius is an American screenwriter, director, and producer of motion pictures. He was one of the writers for the first two Dirty Harry films, received an Academy Award nomination as screenwriter of Apocalypse Now, and wrote and directed The Wind and the Lion, Conan the Barbarian and Red Dawn.\n\nHe wrote a number of iconic film lines such as \"Charlie don't surf\" and \"I love the smell of napalm in the morning,\" from Apocalypse Now, and the famous Dirty Harry one-liners delivered by Clint Eastwood, including \"Go ahead, make my day\" and \"Ask yourself one question, 'do I feel lucky?' Well, do you, punk?\". Milius also wrote the USS Indianapolis monologue in the film Jaws; the sequence performed by Robert Shaw. \n\nAfter his work on Rough Riders (1997), Milius became an instrumental force in lobbying Congress to award President Theodore Roosevelt the Medal of Honor (posthumously), for acts of conspicuous gallantry while in combat on San Juan Hill. Milius made two films featuring Roosevelt: The Wind and the Lion (where he was played by Brian Keith) and the made-for-TV film Rough Riders (where Tom Berenger took the role).\n\nThe character of John Milner from the 1973 George Lucas film American Graffiti was inspired by Milius, who was a good friend of Lucas while they were at USC film school. Likewise, the character Walter Sobchak in the 1998 film The Big Lebowski, made by his friends the Coen Brothers, was partly based on Milius. The novella \"Blind Jozef Pronek and Dead Souls\" by Aleksandar Hemon features an episode with Milius, who is described as \"sitting at a desk sucking on a cigar as long as a walking stick.\"\n\nIn 2013 a documentary about his life, titled Milius, was released.\n\nWriter Nat Segaloff called Milius:\n\n\"The best writer of the so-called USC Mafia, a tight-knit group that resuscitated\u2014some say homogenised American cinema in the 1970s... Raised on Ford, Hawks, Lean and Kurosawa, shaped by filmmakers as disparate as Fellini and Delmer Daves, Milius favours history books over comic books, character over special effects, and heroes with roots in reality, time, place and customs. Milius' stories reflect his own deeply held ethic, which embraces the values of tradition, adventure, spiritualism, honour and an intense loyalty to friends...  Although he privately chafes at his public image as a gun-toting, liberal baiting provocateur, he allows himself to be painted as such, at times even holding the brush. He plays the Hollywood game like a pro, yet sticks to his own rules; he is a romantic filmmaker who avoids love scenes; his movies contain violence, yet no death in them is without meaning.\"\n\nMilius himself once said:\n\n\"Never compromise excellence. To write for someone else is the biggest mistake that any writer makes. You should be your biggest competitor, your biggest critic, your biggest fan, because you don\u2019t know what anybody else thinks. How arrogant it is to assume that you know the market, that you know what\u2019s popular today [...] Write what you want to see. Because if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re not going to have any true passion in it, and it\u2019s not going to be done with any true artistry.\"\n\nDescription from the Wikipedia article John Milius, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Leaving behind a successful commercial business in New York, Wynorski relocated to California in 1980 and soon found himself on the doorstep of his childhood idol, B-film king Roger Corman. \"The rest was destiny,\" recounts Wynorski, who soon found himself hired by the renowned movie mogul to cut \"coming attractions\" for all of the company's new action and horror films. \"It was like grasshopper learning from the kung-fu master,\" says Wynorski, who claims his six-months internship with Corman taught him more than four years at film school.\n\n\"It wasn't long after that Corman offered me the first of many writing/directing assignments. Some distributor wanted a flick about a killer in a shopping mall,\" recalls Wynorski, \"and Roger trusted me enough to say 'come up with something good, and you can direct it.\" Well, a couple days later, the director walked in with the first treatment to a film called Chopping Mall (1986), and the rest was history. From then on, Jim Wynorski turned out an average of three to five films a year as a director, and even more as a producer/writer. Throughout the 1980s came a steady stream of wild exploitation titles like Big Bad Mama II (1987) with Angie Dickinson, Not of This Earth (1988) with Traci Lords and The Return of Swamp Thing (1989) with Heather Locklear. On into the 1990s, Wynorski continued to climb to the top of the B-Film mountain with flicks like Hard Bounty (1995) starring Kelly LeBrock, Point of Seduction III: Body Chemistry (1994) &amp; Body Chemistry 4: Full Exposure (1995) with Shannon Tweed and Morgan Fairchild and Munchie (1992), which featured the first film appearance of the then-unknown 12-year-old child actress Jennifer Love Hewitt.\n\nAs the years peeled by and tastes changed, Jim Wynorski kept hip by innovating new special effects techniques that landed the director no less than seven world premieres on the Sci-Fi Channel. His credits there include films like Gargoyle (2004), The Curse of the Komodo (2004), Project Viper and Cry of the Winged Serpent (2007).\n\nAs for the future, the 59-year-old Wynorski feels the audience for alternative cinema made away from the studio system will continue to grow thanks to new advances in Internet and Cable technologies. In fact, he is in post-production on another thriller, Vampire in Vegas (2009). \"And you can bet I'll be there,\" he offers with a big smile, \"with some really fun stuff.\" Jim has a huge following in the Mid-West and is beloved in Franklin, Indiana, Home of The B Movie Celebration.

        "biography": "Thomas Vinterberg (born 19 May 1969) is a Danish film director who, along with Lars von Trier, co-founded the Dogme 95 movement in filmmaking, which established rules for simplifying movie production. He is best known for the films The Celebration (1998), Submarino (2010), The Hunt (2012) and Far from the Madding Crowd (2015).\n\nVinterberg was born in Frederiksberg, Denmark. In 1993, he graduated from the National Film School of Denmark with Last Round (Sidste Omgang), which won the jury and producers' awards at the Munich International Festival of Film Schools, and First Prize at Tel Aviv. That year Vinterberg made his first TV drama for DR TV and his short fiction film The Boy Who Walked Backwards, produced by Birgitte Hald at Nimbus Film.\n\nThis film has won awards and accolades all over the world, including Nordic Panorama in Iceland, the International Short Film Festival in Clermont-Ferrand, and the Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nHis first feature film was The Biggest Heroes (De St\u00f8rste Helte), a road movie that received acclaim in his native Denmark.\n\nIn 1995, Vinterberg formed the Dogme 95 movement with Lars von Trier, Kristian Levring, and S\u00f8ren Kragh-Jacobsen. Following that dogma in 1998, he conceived, wrote and directed (and also had a small acting role in) the first of the Dogme movies, The Celebration (Festen). As per the rules of the Dogme manifesto, he did not take a directorial credit. However, he and the film won numerous nominations and awards, including the Jury Prize at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nIn 2003 he directed the apocalyptic science fiction love story It's All About Love, a movie he wrote, directed and produced himself over a period of five years. This movie was entirely in English and featured, among others, Joaquin Phoenix, Claire Danes, and Sean Penn. The movie did not do well, as critics and audiences found it idiosyncratic and somewhat incomprehensible. His next film, the English-language Dear Wendy (2005), scripted by Lars von Trier, also flopped, even in his native Denmark where it sold only 14,521 tickets. However he won the Silver George for Best Director at the 27th Moscow International Film Festival. Vinterberg then tried to retrace his roots with a smaller Danish-language production, En mand kommer hjem (2007), which also flopped, selling only 31,232 tickets.\n\nOn 1 August 2008 he directed the music video for \"The Day That Never Comes\", the first single off Metallica's album Death Magnetic.\n\nHis 2010 film Submarino was nominated for the Golden Bear at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nIn 2012, his film The Hunt competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film award at the 86th Academy Awards.\n\nIn 2015, he directed Far From The Madding Crowd, an adaptation of the acclaimed Thomas Hardy novel, starring Carey Mulligan, Matthias Schoenaerts, Michael Sheen and Tom Sturridge.\n\nVinterberg will reunite with Matthias Schoenaerts in Kursk, a film about the Kursk submarine disaster that happened in 2000.\n\nIn April 2016, the French government appointed Vinterberg a Chevalier (Knight) of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Nicole Kassell (born 1972) is an American film director. Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, she received her degree from the Tisch School of the Arts at NYU. While a student there, she made three short films, including The Green Hour, which was screened at the Sundance Film Festival in 2002.\n\nA year earlier, she had won the Slamdance Screenplay Competition for her first feature-length project, The Woodsman, adapted from Steven Fechter's 1997 minimalist play she had seen staged at The Actors Studio in New York City. Her enthusiasm for it convinced Lee Daniels, one of the producers of Monster's Ball, to help her get funding for the film version. When he approached Kevin Bacon, the actor was so impressed by the script, about a convicted child molester forced to deal with social prejudice and the fear he will not be able to control his dark urges after he's released from prison, that he suggested he star in the movie opposite wife Kyra Sedgwick. The Woodsman competed at Sundance and the Toronto International Film Festival, was featured in the Director\u2019s Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival, and eventually was released to the public in 2004. Kassell's second feature film, A Little Bit of Heaven, a romantic comedy starring Kate Hudson and Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal, had its first release in February 2011 in the UK.\n\nKassell has directed episodes of the series Cold Case and 3 lbs (both on CBS), The Closer (on TNT) and The Killing (on AMC). She has adapted Arthur Miller's play The Ride Down Mt. Morgan for the big screen. At present, the project is in pre-production with a cast that includes Diane Keaton, Emily Blunt, and Michael Douglas, who is serving as executive producer.

Other films directed by Ashby include The Landlord (1970), Harold and Maude (1971), The Last Detail (1973), Shampoo (1975), Bound for Glory (1976) and Being There (1979).\n\nBorn William Hal Ashby in Ogden, Utah, he grew up in a Mormon household. His tumultuous childhood as part of a dysfunctional family included the divorce of his parents, his father's suicide, and dropping out of high school. Ashby was married and divorced by the time he was 19.\n\nAs Ashby was entering adult life, he moved from Utah to California where he soon became an assistant film editor. After being nominated for the Academy Award for Film Editing in 1967 for The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming, his big break occurred in 1968 when he won the award for In the Heat of the Night. \n\nAt the urging of producer Norman Jewison, Ashby directed his first film The Landlord in 1970. While his birth date placed him squarely within the realm of the prewar generation, the filmmaker quickly embraced the hippie lifestyle, adopting vegetarianism and growing his hair long. In 1970 he married actress Joan Marshall. While they remained married until his death in 1988, the two had separated by the mid-seventies, with Marshall never forgiving Ashby, along with Warren Beatty and Robert Towne, for dramatizing certain unflattering elements of her life in Shampoo.\n\nOver the next 16 years, Ashby directed several acclaimed and popular films, many were about outsiders and adventurers traversing the pathways of life. Aside from Shampoo, Ashby's most commercially successful film was the Vietnam War drama Coming Home (1978). Starring Jane Fonda and Jon Voight, both in Academy Award-winning performances, it was for this film that Ashby earned his only Best Director nomination from the Academy for his work. \n\nAfter Being There (his last film to achieve widespread attention), Ashby became notoriously reclusive and eccentric, retreating to his home in Malibu Colony. Later it was learned that Ashby was using drugs, and he slowly became difficult and unemployable.\n\nAttempting to turn a corner in his declining career, Ashby stopped using drugs, trimmed his hair and beard, and began to frequently attend Hollywood parties wearing a navy blue blazer so as to suggest that he was once again employable. Despite these efforts, he could only find work as a television director.\n\nAshby died on December 27, 1988 at his home in Malibu, California.\n\nThe Last Detail, Bound for Glory, Coming Home, and Being There were all nominated for the Palme d'Or.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.  Elia Kazan ( September 7 , 1909, Kayseri \u2013 September 28, 2003) was a Greek-American director and actor, described as \"one of the most honored and influential directors in Broadway and Hollywood history\". He also produced, and wrote screenplays and novels. Born in the Kayseri, Ottoman Empire to Greek parents, they emigrated to New York when he was four. After two years studying acting at Yale, he acted professionally for eight years before becoming a stage and film director. Kazan co-founded the influential Group Theater in 1932 and Actors Studio in 1947, and together with Lee Strasberg, introduced Method acting to the American stage and cinema as a new form of self-expression and psychological \"realism\". Having been an actor himself for eight years, he brought sensitivity and understanding of the acting process, and was later considered the ideal \"actor's director\". He himself acted in only a few films, including City for Conquest (1940), alongside James Cagney.\n\nKazan introduced a new generation of unknown young actors to the movie audiences, including Marlon Brando and James Dean, but was most noted for drawing out the best dramatic performances from his actors. As a result, he directed 21 different actors to Oscar nominations, resulting in nine wins. He became \"one of the consummate filmmakers of the 20th century\", after directing a continual string of successful films, including, A Streetcar Named Desire, On the Waterfront, and East of Eden. During his career, he won two Oscars as Best Director and received an Honorary Oscar, won three Tony Awards, and four Golden Globes. Among the other new actors he introduced to movie audiences for the first time, were Warren Beatty, Carroll Baker, Julie Harris, Andy Griffith, Lee Remick, Rip Torn, Eli Wallach, Eva Marie Saint, Martin Balsam, Fred Gwynne, and Pat Hingle. He also elicited some of the best performances in the careers of actors like Natalie Wood and James Dunn. Producer George Stevens, Jr. concludes that Kazan's films and new actors have \"changed American moviemaking\".\n\nMost of his films were concerned with personal or social issues of special concern to him. Kazan writes, \"I don't move unless I have some empathy with the basic theme. In some way the channel of the film should also be in my own life.\" His first such \"issue\" film was Gentleman's Agreement (1947), with Gregory Peck, which dealt with hidden anti-Semitism in America. It received 8 Oscar nominations and 3 wins, and Kazan's first for Best Director. It was followed by Pinky, one of the first films to address racial prejudice against blacks. In 1954, he directed On the Waterfront, a film about union corruption in New York, which some consider \"one of the greatest films in the history of international cinema.\" A major film earlier in his career was A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), an adaptation of the stage play which he had also directed. It received 12 Oscar nominations, winning 4, and was Marlon Brando's breakthrough role, although his screen debut was the previous year, 1950, playing a paraplegic war veteran in 'The Men'. In 1955, he directed John Steinbeck's East of Eden, which also introduced James Dean to movie audiences for the first time, making him an overnight star.\n\nA turning point in Kazan's career came with his testimony as a \"friendly witness\" before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1952, which cost him the respect of many liberal friends and colleagues, such as playwright Arthur Miller. Kazan later explains that he took \"only the more tolerable of two alternatives that were either way painful and wrong\". Overall, Kazan influenced the films of the 1950s and 1960s by his run of provocative, issues-driven subjects, and acting. Moreover, his personal brand of cinema, employing real locations over sets, unknowns over stars, and realism over convenient genres, proved influential to a whole generation of independent filmmakers in the 1960s, such as Sidney Lumet, John Cassavetes, Arthur Penn, Woody Allen, and Martin Scorsese. Film author Ian Freer concludes that \"If his achievements are tainted by political controversy, the debt Hollywood \u2014 and actors everywhere \u2014 owes him, is enormous.\" In 2010, Martin Scorsese co-directed the documentary film, A Letter to Elia, as a personal tribute to Kazan, who he credits as the inspiration for his becoming a filmmaker.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Elia Kazan, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Using the centre's facilities, he was a very prolific director of video dramas and collaborated with a number of other directors in different roles including cameraman. A major influence was the centre's video maker, Dermot Byrne with whom he worked on a number of projects. It was at 33 that he met the future film composer David Arnold who played in a band that rehearsed there. Cannon convinced Arnold that he could compose soundtracks for his and other people's videos. Arnold's first but not the last soundtrack for Byrne was 'The Undead' written by Keith Moyes.\n\nIn 1987 Cannon, then a teenager, entered a competition in the British comic 2000 AD to design a poster for a possible future film of Judge Dredd. His work was published in the comic's \"Prog 534\" edition. In his poster, a clearly Blade Runner\u2013inspired Cannon imagined that the director of the film would be Ridley Scott, with Harrison Ford starring in the title role and Daryl Hannah co-starring as \"PSI Anderson\".\n\nBy 1987 he was awarded the BBC Young Filmmaker of the Year Award for a 40-minute short called Sometimes. He enrolled at the National Film and Television School in 1988, from which he graduated in 1990.\n\nHe wrote and directed Strangers (1990) and The Young Americans (1993), the latter having as its title song, \"Play Dead\", sung by Icelandic diva Bj\u00f6rk. Based on his work on the later gangster film, producers signed him to direct the big-budget, but ultimately poorly received film Judge Dredd (1995), starring Sylvester Stallone. Since then he has also directed Phoenix (1998), and I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (1998). Beginning in 2000, he has directed and produced various CSI television series. In 2005 he directed Goal!. Cannon also plays football regularly with Hollywood United F.C. The team mostly features celebrities and former professional footballers. They do however, occasionally play against professional teams for friendly matches and charity events.\n\nHe directed a 2006 CBS television pilot, Capital Law, about a group of legal associates trying to make partner at a powerful Washington, D.C.\u2013based law firm. More recently, Cannon co-created TNT's crime drama series starring Dylan McDermott, called Dark Blue. Cannon also directed the pilot episode for Dark Blue.\n\nIn 2010, Cannon joined The CW action series Nikita, as director and executive producer.\n\nIn 2011, Cannon executive produced and directed the pilot for the FOX crime/mystery Alcatraz.",

Aldrich and a cousin of Nelson Rockefeller. He studied economics at the University of Virginia. \n\nIn 1941, he dropped out of college for a $50-a-week job at RKO Radio Pictures. In doing so, he was also dropped by his family, losing a potential stake in Chase Bank he would have inherited. It's been said that \"No American film director was born as wealthy as Aldrich\u2014and then so thoroughly cut off from family money.\"\n\nHe quickly rose in film production as an assistant director, and worked with Jean Renoir, Abraham Polonsky, Robert Rossen, Joseph Losey and Charlie Chaplin as an assistant on Limelight. He became a television director in the 1950s, directing his first feature film, Big Leaguer, in 1953. During the 1950s, Aldrich directed mostly action films like Apache and Vera Cruz with Burt Lancaster. \n\nAldrich soon gained recognition as an auteur filmmaker, depicting his liberal humanist thematic vision in many genres, in films such as Kiss Me Deadly (1955), a film noir classic, The Big Knife (1955), an adaptation of Clifford Odets's play about Hollywood business, and Attack (1956), a WWII infantry combat film exploring how U.S. Army careerism determined who attacked and who ordered the attack.\n\nIn the 1960s, he directed several commercially successful films, such as the gothic horror stories What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962), with Bette Davis and Joan Crawford as spiteful sisters and faded child-actresses, Hush\u2026 Hush, Sweet Charlotte, with Bette Davis as a Southern woman who lives in a mansion and thinks she is going insane (both Joan Crawford and Davis were to appear, but Crawford left the film); the controversial The Killing of Sister George (1968); and the hugely popular war film The Dirty Dozen (1967).\n\nThe success of The Dirty Dozen allowed him to establish his own production studio for some time, but several failures forced his return to conventionally commercial Hollywood films. Nevertheless, his humanism is evident in The Longest Yard (1974), about the rigged-game politics, and Ulzana's Raid (1972) an uncompromising film based on the real life break-out from an Indian reservation of a band led by chief Ulzana, the extreme violence and torture they exacted upon isolated pioneer families in the Arizona territory, and their pursuit by the US cavalry.\n\nFrom his marriage to Harriet Foster (1941\u201365), Robert Aldrich had four children, all of whom work in the film business: Adell, William, Alida and Kelly. \n\nAldrich died of kidney failure on December 5, 1983 in a Los Angeles hospital. \n\nFilm critic John Patterson summarized his career in 2012: \"He was a punchy, caustic, macho and pessimistic director, who depicted corruption and evil unflinchingly, and pushed limits on violence throughout his career. His aggressive and pugnacious film-making style, often crass and crude, but never less than utterly vital and alive, warrants \u2013 and will richly reward \u2013 your immediate attention.\"\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Robert Aldrich, licensed under CC-BY-SA",

He was noted for his work with actor Paul Newman.\n\nRosenberg was born in Brooklyn, New York City, the son of Sara (n\u00e9e Kaminsky) and David Rosenberg. He studied Irish literature at New York University in Manhattan, and began working as an apprentice film editor while in graduate school.\n\nAfter advancing to film editor, he then transitioned into directing with episodes of the syndicated TV series Decoy (1957\u201359). It was the first police series on American television built around a female protagonist. Over the next two years, Rosenberg directed 15 episodes of the ABC police-detective series Naked City, also shot in New York City. Fifteen episodes of The Untouchables followed, eight of the anthology series Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre, five of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, and three of The Twilight Zone, along with episodes of Adventures in Paradise, The Barbara Stanwyck Show, Ben Casey, Rawhide with Clint Eastwood, and Falk's The Trials of O'Brien, among other shows. He won a 1963 Emmy Award for directing \"The Madman\", one of his 19 episodes of the courtroom drama The Defenders.\n\nFollowing the Lutheran-financed U.S.-German co-production Question 7 (1961), filmed in West Berlin, Germany, Rosenberg shot the 1965 TV-movie, Memorandum for a Spy and the 1966 telefilm Fame Is the Name of the Game before making his major-studio debut with the Paul Newman hit Cool Hand Luke (1967). Rosenberg had come across Donn Pearce's chain gang novel and developed the film with actor Jack Lemmon's production company, Jalem. Years later, Rosenberg would replace Bob Rafelson on another prison movie, Brubaker (1980) starring Robert Redford.\n\nOther Rosenberg films include The April Fools (1969), with French actress Catherine Deneuve in her American debut opposite Jack Lemmon; the Newman movies WUSA (1970), Pocket Money (1972) and The Drowning Pool (1975); the Walter Matthau police-detective thriller The Laughing Policeman (1973); the Charles Bronson action picture Love and Bullets (1979); and another action movie Let's Get Harry (1986), for which Rosenberg used the Directors Guild of America pseudonym Alan Smithee. He was famous for straight dramas and, especially, crime films. The most acclaimed movie he did after 'Cool Hand Luke' was The Pope of Greenwich Village with Eric Roberts, Mickey Rourke, and Daryl Hannah.\n\nHe made his last film, the independent drama My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys, in 1991.\n\nIn 1993, Rosenberg became a teacher at the American Film Institute. Among his students were those who would go on to make names for themselves: Todd Field, Darren Aronofsky, Mark Waters, Scott Silver, Doug Ellin and Rob Schmidt.\n\nRosenberg died in 2007 of a heart attack at his home in Beverly Hills, California. He was survived by his wife, Margot Pohoryles, whom he had met at NYU; son Benjamin Rosenberg, a first assistant director; as well as four grandchildren.\n\nHis students' films The Spiderwick Chronicles, The Alphabet Killer, and The Wrestler that were released in 2008 were dedicated in memory of him.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Stuart Rosenberg, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.\u200b",

He was considered one of the last remaining directors who insisted on having complete control over all elements of production, making his style unique in Hollywood.\n\nHis 30 feature films and over 50 plays for television were notable for their influence on contemporary thought. He became a pioneer of the \"modern-day political thriller,\" having begun his career at the peak of the Cold War. Many of his films were noted for creating \"psychological dilemmas\" for his male protagonists along with having a strong \"sense of environment,\" similar in style to films by director Sidney Lumet, for whom he had earlier worked as assistant director. He developed a \"tremendous propensity for exploring political situations\" which would ensnare his characters.\n\nMovie critic Leonard Maltin writes that \"in his time [1960s]... Frankenheimer worked with the top writers, producers and actors in a series of films that dealt with issues that were just on top of the moment\u2014things that were facing us all.\" Among his credits were The Manchurian Candidate (1962), Birdman of Alcatraz (also 1962), The Train, (1964), Seven Days in May (also 1964) and Ronin (1998).\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article John Frankenheimer, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nJames Whale (22 July 1889 \u2013 29 May 1957) was an English film director, theatre director and actor. He is best remembered for his work in the horror film genre, having directed Frankenstein (1931), The Old Dark House (1932), The Invisible Man (1933) and Bride of Frankenstein (1935), all recognized as classics of the genre. Whale directed over a dozen films in other genres, including what is considered the definitive film version of the musical Show Boat (1936). He became increasingly disenchanted with his association with horror, but many of his non-horror films have fallen into obscurity.\n\nBorn into a large family in Dudley, England, Whale early discovered his artistic talent and studied art. With the outbreak of World War I, Whale enlisted in the British Army and became an officer. He was captured by the Germans and during his time as a prisoner of war he realized he was interested in drama. Following his release at the end of the war he became an actor, set designer and director. His success directing the 1928 play Journey's End led to his move to the United States, first to direct the play on Broadway and then to Hollywood to direct motion pictures. Whale lived in Hollywood for the rest of his life, most of that time with his longtime companion, producer David Lewis. Including Journey's End (1930), Whale directed a dozen films for Universal Studios between 1930 and 1936 (his uncredited work on the war epic Hell's Angels having been done for United Artists), developing a style characterized by the influence of German Expressionism and a highly mobile camera.\n\nAt the height of his popularity as a director, Whale directed The Road Back, a sequel to All Quiet on the Western Front, in 1937. Studio interference, possibly spurred by political pressure from Nazi Germany, led to the film's being altered from Whale's vision and The Road Back was a critical and commercial failure. A string of commercial failures followed and, while Whale would make one final short film in 1950, by 1941 his film directing career was over. Whale continued to direct for the stage and also rediscovered his love for painting and travel. His investments made him wealthy and he lived a comfortable retirement until suffering strokes in 1956 that robbed him of his vigor and left him in pain. Whale committed suicide on 29 May 1957 by drowning himself in his backyard swimming pool.\n\nWhale was openly gay throughout his career, something that was very unusual in the 1920s and 1930s. As knowledge of his sexual orientation has become more common, some of his films, Bride of Frankenstein in particular, have been interpreted as having a gay subtext and it has been claimed that Whale's refusal to remain in the closet led to the end of his career. However, Whale's associates dismiss the notions that Whale's sexuality informed his work or that it cost him his career.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article James Whale, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Writer Octavio Paz called Bu\u00f1uel's work \"the marriage of the film image to the poetic image, creating a new reality... scandalous and subversive\".\n\nOften associated with the surrealist movement of the 1920s, Bu\u00f1uel created films from the 1920s through the 1970s. His work spans two continents, three languages, and an array of genres, including experimental film, documentary, melodrama, satire, musical, erotica, comedy, romance, costume dramas, fantasy, crime film, adventure, and western. Despite this variety, filmmaker John Huston believed that, regardless of genre, a Bu\u00f1uel film is so distinctive as to be instantly recognizable, or, as Ingmar Bergman put it, \"Bu\u00f1uel nearly always made Bu\u00f1uel films\".\n\nSix of Bu\u00f1uel's films are included in Sight & Sound's 2012 critics' poll of the top 250 films of all time. Fifteen of his films are included in the They Shoot Pictures, Don't They? list of the 1,000 greatest films of all time, which is tied with John Ford for second most, and he ranks number 14 on their list of the top 250 directors.",

        "biography": "Brian Trenchard-Smith is an Anglo Australian film and television director, producer, and writer, with a reputation for large scale movies on small scale budgets, many of which display a quirky sense of humor that has earned him a cult following. Quentin Tarantino referred to him in Entertainment Weekly as one of his favorite directors. His early work is featured in Not Quite Hollywood, an award\u00a0winning documentary released by Magnolia. Among his early successes were the 20th Century Fox release The Man from Hong Kong, a wry James Bond/Chop Sockey cocktail, the Vietnam battle movie Siege of Firebase Gloria, and the futuristic satire Dead End Drive-In, a particular Tarantino favorite. BMX Bandits, showcasing a 15-year old Nicole Kidman, and Miramax's The Quest, starring ET's Henry Thomas, won prizes at children's film festivals in Montreal and Europe. He has also directed 35 episodes of television series as diverse as Silk Stalkings, Time Trax, The Others, and Flipper. Born in England, where his Australian father was in the RAF, Trenchard-Smith attended UK's prestigious Wellington College, where he neglected studies in favor of acting and making short films, before migrating to Australia. He started as a news film editor, then graduated to network promos before he became one of a group of young people that, as he recalls, \"pushed, shoved, lobbied and bullied the government into introducing investment for Australian made films.\" He persuaded Australia's largest distribution-exhibition circuit at the time, the Greater Union Theater Organization, to form an in-house production company that he would run. The company made three successful films in a row, and his career was underway. In parallel careers, he was also founding editor of Australia's quarterly Movie magazine for 6 years, and has made over 100 trailers for other directors in Australia, Europe, and America. Among his 39 movies, 5 were commissioned by Showtime, including the remake of the World War II classic, Sahara, the highly rated, Happy Face Murders, starring Ann-Margret, and DC 9/11: Time of Crisis, with Timothy Bottoms as President Bush. His frequently repeated family drama for Lifetime, Long Lost Son starring Gabrielle Anwar, introduced future Gossip Girl's Chace Crawford to audiences in the title role.\" I knew from his first scene, he was going to be hot.\" In 2009, Trenchard-Smith shot Porky's - The College Years, a re-imagining of the famous 80's franchise of teen comedies. His recent ecological thriller Arctic Blast, starring Michael Shanks, was chosen to premiere at the 2010 Possible Worlds Canadian Film Festival in Sydney. Trenchard-Smith writes for filmindustrybloggers.com as The Genre Director, and is a contributing guru to trailersfromhell.com. He is married to Byzantine historian Dr. Margaret Trenchard-Smith, lives in Los Angeles, and is a member of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.",

He was born in Aldershot, Hampshire.\n\nThe son of an army officer, he attended Charterhouse School as a boy, graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and worked for some years as an actor, director and stage manager.

Robbery (1967), a crime thriller, is a fictionalised version of the Great Train Robbery of 1963. This led to Bullitt (1968), of which Bruce Weber has written, \"Mr. Yates\u2019s reputation probably rests most securely on \u201cBullitt\u201d (1968), his first American film \u2014 and indeed, on one particular scene, an extended car chase that instantly became a classic.\"\n\nYates was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Direction for Bullitt (1968). Yates produced and directed Breaking Away (1979), which was nominated for five Academy Awards (\"Oscars\") including Best Director and Best Film for Yates.

In later years he claimed to have devised the cry \"Hi-yo, Silver\" because he couldn't whistle for his horse as the script required.\n\nSeaton joined Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as a contract writer in 1933. His first major screen credit was the Marx Brothers comedy A Day at the Races in 1937. In the early 1940s he joined 20th Century Fox, where he remained for the rest of the decade, writing scripts for Moon Over Miami, Coney Island, Charley's Aunt, The Song of Bernadette, and others before making his directorial debut with Diamond Horseshoe in 1945. From this point on he was credited as both screenwriter and director for most of his films, including The Shocking Miss Pilgrim, Miracle on 34th Street, Apartment for Peggy, Chicken Every Sunday, The Big Lift, For Heaven's Sake, Little Boy Lost, The Country Girl, and The Proud and Profane.\n\nBut Not Goodbye, Seaton's 1944 Broadway debut as a playwright, closed after only 23 performances, although it later was adapted for the 1946 film The Cockeyed Miracle by Karen DeWolf. In 1967 he returned to Broadway to direct the Norman Krasna play Love in E Flat, which was a critical and commercial flop. The musical Here's Love, adapted from his screenplay for Miracle on 34th Street by Meredith Willson, proved to be more successful.\n\nSeaton won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay twice, for Miracle on 34th Street (which also earned him the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay) and The Country Girl, and was nominated for Oscars three additional times. He received The Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 1961.\n\nSeaton died of cancer in Beverly Hills, California.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article George Seaton, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

After training as a film editor in the mid-1940s, he went on to direct a number of short films which included Night and Fog (1955), an influential documentary about the Nazi concentration camps.\n\nResnais began making feature films in the late 1950s and consolidated his early reputation with Hiroshima mon amour (1959), Last Year at Marienbad (1961), and Muriel (1963), all of which adopted unconventional narrative techniques to deal with themes of troubled memory and the imagined past. These films were contemporary with, and associated with, the French New Wave (la nouvelle vague), though Resnais did not regard himself as being fully part of that movement. He had closer links to the \"Left Bank\" group of authors and filmmakers who shared a commitment to modernism and an interest in left-wing politics. He also established a regular practice of working on his films in collaboration with writers previously unconnected with the cinema such as Jean Cayrol, Marguerite Duras, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Jorge Sempr\u00fan and Jacques Sternberg.\n\nIn later films, Resnais moved away from the overtly political topics of some previous works and developed his interests in an interaction between cinema and other cultural forms, including theatre, music, and comic books. This led to imaginative adaptations of plays by Alan Ayckbourn, Henri Bernstein and Jean Anouilh, as well as films featuring various kinds of popular song.\n\nHis films frequently explore the relationship between consciousness, memory, and the imagination, and he was noted for devising innovative formal structures for his narratives. Throughout his career, he won many awards from international film festivals and academies.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Alain Resnais, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.  Terence Fisher (23 February 1904 \u2013 18 June 1980) was a film director who worked for Hammer Films. He was born in Maida Vale, a district of London, England.\n\nFisher was one of the most prominent horror directors of the second half of the 20th century. He was the first to bring gothic horror alive in full colour, and the sexual overtones and explicit horror in his films, while mild by modern standards, were unprecedented in his day. His first major gothic horror film was The Curse of Frankenstein (1957), which launched Hammer's long association with the genre and made British actors Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee leading horror stars of the era. He went on to film a number of adaptations of classic horror subjects, including Dracula (1958), The Hound of the Baskervilles (1959) and The Mummy (1959).\n\nGiven their subject matter and lurid approach, Fisher's films, though commercially successful, were largely dismissed by critics during his career. It is only in recent years that Fisher has become recognised as an auteur in his own right. His films are characterised by a blend of fairy-tale, myth and sexuality. They draw heavily on Christian themes, and there is usually a hero who defeats the powers of darkness by a combination of faith in God and reason, in contrast to other characters, who are either blindly superstitious or bound by a cold, godless rationalism (as noted by critic Paul Leggett in Terence Fisher: Horror, Myth and Religion, 2001). For a detailed discussion of Fisher's works, see The Charm of Evil: The Films of Terence Fisher by Wheeler Winston Dixon (Metuchen N.J. and London: Scarecrow Press, 1991).\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Terence Fisher, licensed under CC-BY-SA,full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nLouis Marie Malle was a French film director, screenwriter, and producer. His film Le Monde du silence won the Palme d'Or in 1956 and the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1957, although he was not credited at the ceremony with the award instead being presented to the film's co-director Jacques Cousteau. Later in his career he was nominated multiple times for Academy Awards. Malle is also one of the few directors to have won the Golden Lion multiple times.\n\nMalle worked in both French cinema and Hollywood, and he produced both French and English language films. His most famous films include the crime film Ascenseur pour l'\u00e9chafaud (1958), the World War II drama Lacombe, Lucien (1974), the romantic crime film Atlantic City (1980), the comedy-drama My Dinner with Andre (1981), and the autobiographical film Au revoir les enfants (1987).\n\nMalle was born into a wealthy industrialist family in Thumeries, Nord, France. He initially studied political science at Sciences Po before turning to film studies at IDHEC instead.\n\nHe worked as the co-director and cameraman to Jacques Cousteau on the documentary The Silent World (1956), which won an Oscar and the Palme d'Or at the 1956 Academy Awards and Cannes Film Festival respectively. He assisted Robert Bresson on A Man Escaped (French title: Un condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 mort s'est \u00e9chapp\u00e9 ou Le vent souffle o\u00f9 il veut, 1956) before making his first feature, Ascenseur pour l'\u00e9chafaud in 1957 (Elevator to the Gallows). A taut thriller featuring an original score by Miles Davis, Ascenseur pour l'\u00e9chafaud made an international film star of Jeanne Moreau, at the time a leading stage actress of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise. Malle was 24 years old.\n\nMalle's The Lovers (Les Amants, 1958), which also starred Moreau, caused major controversy due to its sexual content, leading to a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case regarding the legal definition of obscenity. \n\nMalle is sometimes associated with the nouvelle vague movement. Malle's work does not directly fit in with or correspond to the auteurist theories that apply to the work of Godard, Truffaut, Chabrol, Rohmer and others, and he had nothing whatsoever to do with the Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma. However, it does exemplify many of the characteristics of the movement, such as using natural light and shooting on location, and his film Zazie dans le m\u00e9tro (\"Zazie in the Metro,\" 1960, an adaptation of the Raymond Queneau novel) inspired Truffaut to write an enthusiastic letter to Malle.\n\nIn 1968 Malle visited India and made a seven-part documentary series L'Inde fant\u00f4me: Reflexions sur un voyage and a documentary film Calcutta, which was released in cinemas. Concentrating on real India, its rituals and festivities, Malle fell afoul of the Indian government, which disliked his portrayal of the country, in its fascination with the pre-modern, and consequently banned the BBC from filming in India for several years. Malle later claimed his documentary on India was his favorite film.\n\nMalle later moved to the United States and continued to direct there. Just as his earlier films such as The Lovers helped popularize French films in the United States, My Dinner with Andre was at the forefront of the rise of American independent cinema in the 1980s.",

Regarded as one of the most important and influential filmmakers in the history of cinema, Kurosawa directed 30 films in a career spanning 57 years. Kurosawa entered the Japanese film industry in 1936, following a brief stint as a painter. After years of working on numerous films as an assistant director and scriptwriter, he made his debut as a director in 1943, during World War II with the popular action film Sanshiro Sugata (a.k.a. Judo Saga). After the war, the critically acclaimed Drunken Angel (1948), in which Kurosawa cast then-unknown actor Toshir\u014d Mifune in a starring role, cemented the director's reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan. The two men would go on to collaborate on another 15 films. Rashomon, which premiered in Tokyo in August 1950, and which also starred Mifune, became, on September 10, 1951, the surprise winner of the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival and was subsequently released in Europe and North America. The commercial and critical success of this film opened up Western film markets for the first time to the products of the Japanese film industry, which in turn led to international recognition for other Japanese film artists. Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, Kurosawa directed approximately a film a year, including a number of highly regarded films such as Ikiru (1952), Seven Samurai (1954) and Yojimbo (1961). After the mid-1960s, he became much less prolific, but his later work\u2014including his final two epics, Kagemusha (1980) and Ran (1985)\u2014continued to win awards, including the Palme d'Or for Kagemusha, though more often abroad than in Japan. In 1990, he accepted the Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement.Posthumously, he was named \"Asian of the Century\" in the \"Arts, Literature, and Culture\" category by AsianWeek magazine and CNN, cited as \"one of the [five] people who contributed most to the betterment of Asia in the past 100 years\".\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Akira Kurosawa , licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "Born in 1930, Jean-Luc Godard became acquainted, while at university, with Claude Chabrol, Francois Truffaut, Eric Rohmer and Jacques Rivette, forming part of a group of passionate young film critics writing in Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma, and film-makers devoted to exploring new possibilities in cinema. A bout de souffle (Breathless) (1959) was his first feature. Made on a shoe-string budget, it was spontaneous, vibrant and ground breakingly original. From then until 1967/8 was loosely his first period when he made an astonishing number of films, sometimes 3 a year. From 68 Godard was very involved in political film-making, and then made a series of programmes for French TV in the mid and late 70\u2019s. With Sauve qui peut (la vie) or Slow Motion, Godard could be said to start a 3rd period through the 80\u2019s. In the 90\u2019s he started more formal experimentation, specifically with his long series Histoire(s) du Cin\u00e9ma. His films have influenced film-makers as diverse as Robert Altman, Martin Scorsese, Jim Jarmusch, Steven Soderbergh, Quentin Tarantino and Wong Kar-Wai. His latest film, Film Socialisme, received its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival (Un Certain Regard) to great acclaim. Jean-Luc Godard was awarded an honorary Oscar in 2010.",

On his return, Franju studied to become a set designer and later created backdrops for music halls including Casino de Paris and the Folles Berg\u00e8re.\n\nIn the mid-thirties, Franju and Henri Langlois met through Franju's twin brother Jacques Franju. As well as creating the 16 mm short film Le M\u00e9tro, Langlois and Franju also started a short-lived film magazine and created a film club called Le Cercle du Cinema with 500 francs he borrowed from Langlois' parents. The club showed silent films from their own collections followed by an informal debate about them amongst members. From Le Cercle du Cinema, Franju and Langlois founded the Cin\u00e9matheque Fran\u00e7aise in 1936.\n\nFranju ceased to be closely related with the Cin\u00e9matheque Fran\u00e7aise as early as 1938, and only became associated with it strongly again in the 1980s when he was appointed as the honorary artistic director of the Cin\u00e9matheque.\n\nIn 1949, Franju began work on a series of nine documentary films. The Nazi occupation of Paris and the industrialism following World War II influenced Franju's early works. \n\nWith Head Against the Wall (French:La t\u00eate contre les murs) in 1958, Franju turned toward fiction feature films. His second feature was the horror film Eyes Without a Face (French:Les Yeux sans Visage) about a surgeon who tries to repair his daughter's ruined face by grafting on to it the faces of beautiful women. His 1963 film Judex was a tribute to the silent film serials Judex and Fantomas. In Franju's later years his film work became less frequent. Franju occasionally directed for television and in the late seventies he retired from filmmaking to preside over the Cin\u00e9matheque Fran\u00e7aise. \n\nIn her study of French cinema since the French new wave, Claire Clouzot described Franju's film style as \"a poignant fantastic realism inherited from surrealism and Jean Painlev\u00e9 science cinema, and influenced by the expressionism of Lang and Murnau\". Franju's focus was on the visual aspect of filmmaking, which he claimed marked a director as an auteur. Franju claimed to \"not have the story writing gift\" and was focused on what he described as the \"putting into form\" of the film.\n\nFranju was also extremely influenced by surrealism. He used elements of surrealism and shock horror within his films in order to \u201cawaken\u201d his audience. Franju had a long history of friendship with well-known surrealists including Andre Breton, and the influence of this movement is extremely evident in his works. Franju uses these elements to link horror, history, and an ironic commentary on modernity\u2019s ideal of progress. Franju is quoted as having said \u201cIt\u2019s the bad combination, it\u2019s the wrong synthesis, constantly being made by the eye as it looks around, that stops us from seeing everything as strange.\u201d \n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Georges Franju , licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He also made the documentaries The Perils of Priscilla (1969), and Rodeo (1970).\n\nHe was second unit director on George Lucas' Star Wars for which he handled many of the outdoor desert scenes. His first solo directing job came when Francis Ford Coppola, a former UCLA classmate, offered him the job of directing The Black Stallion (1979), an adaptation from the novel of the same name by Walter Farley. He went on to direct Never Cry Wolf (1983), a film based on Farley Mowat's autobiographical book of the same name, detailing his experiences with Arctic wolves. He also directed the film Wind (1992).\n\nHe later directed the film Fly Away Home (1996), which was nominated for an Academy Award for best cinematography. His most recent film is Duma (2005), about a young South African boy's friendship with an orphaned cheetah. Most of Ballard's films deal with man and his relation to nature and have a strong poetic streak.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Carroll Ballard, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He was the son of the actor Gerald Hamer (1886-1972).\n\nHamer was won a scholarship to Cambridge University but was sent down (expelled) from Cambridge, and began his career in 1934 as a cutting room assistant and from 1935 worked as a film editor involved with such films as Hitchcock's Jamaica Inn (1939) co-produced by Charles Laughton. At the end of the 1930s, he worked on documentaries for the GPO Film Unit.\n\nWhen his boss at the GPO Alberto Cavalcanti moved to Ealing Studios, Hamer was invited to join him there. He gained some experience as a director by substituting for colleagues and contributed the 'haunted mirror' sequence to Dead of Night (1945). He followed this with the three Ealing films under his own name for which he is best remembered: Pink String and Sealing Wax (1946), It Always Rains on Sunday (1947), both featuring Googie Withers, and the black comedy Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949), with Dennis Price and Alec Guinness.\n\nHamer died of pneumonia at the age of 52 at St Thomas's Hospital in London.

Medem was born in San Sebasti\u00e1n, Basque Country and showed an interest in movies since childhood, when he would take his father's Super 8 camera and shoot at night, while nobody was paying attention. After college graduation (where he earned degrees in Medicine and General Surgery) he worked as a film critic and later as a screenwriter, assistant director and editor. After a few shorts he directed his first full length feature, Vacas ('Cows') for which he won a Goya Award. After this film he directed The Red Squirrel and Earth, both receiving good reviews at Cannes. In his next movie, Lovers of the Arctic Circle, which has been compared to the works of Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski, he explored circular narrative and a taste for minimalistic textures that he then overcame in his next film, Sex and Lucia, where the plot dissolves into a very lyrical eroticism. After this film he took a tangent from his style to direct and produce La pelota vasca ('The Basque Ball'), a documentary film about the political problems of the Basque Country, which caused a furor amongst Spain's right wing politicians. Following this, his film Ca\u00f3tica Ana debuted in 2007.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Julio M\u00e9dem, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

With his weird counter-culture friends as his cast, he began making silent 8mm and 16mm films in the mid-'60s; he screened these in rented Baltimore church halls to underground audiences drawn by word of mouth and street leafleting campaigns. As his filmmaking grew more polished and his subject matter more shocking, his audiences grew bigger, and his write-ups in the Baltimore papers more outraged. By the early 1970s he was making features, which he managed to get shown in midnight screenings in art cinemas by sheer perseverance. Success came when\u00a0Pink Flamingos\u00a0(1972) - a deliberate exercise in ultra-bad taste - took off in 1973, helped no doubt by lead actor\u00a0Divine's infamous dog-crap eating scene.  Waters continued to make low-budget shocking movies with his Dreamland repertory company until Hollywood crossover success came with\u00a0Hairspray\u00a0(1988), and although his movies nowadays might now appear cleaned up and professional, they retain Waters' playfulness, and reflect his lifelong obsessions.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.  John Marcellus Huston (August 5, 1906 \u2013 August 28, 1987) was an American film director, screenwriter and actor. He wrote most of the 37 feature films he directed, many of which are today considered classics: The Maltese Falcon (1941), The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948), Key Largo (1948), The Asphalt Jungle (1950), The African Queen (1951), Moulin Rouge (1952), The Misfits (1961), and The Man Who Would Be King (1975). During his 46-year career, Huston received 15 Oscar nominations, winning twice, and directed both his father, Walter Huston, and daughter, Anjelica Huston to Oscar wins in different films.\n\nHuston was known to direct with the vision of an artist, having studied and worked as a fine art painter in Paris in his early years. He continued to explore the visual aspects of his films throughout his career: sketching each scene on paper beforehand, then carefully framing his characters during the shooting. In addition, while most directors rely on post-production editing to shape their final work, Huston instead created his films while they were being shot, making his films both more economical and more cerebral, with little editing needed.\n\nMost of Huston's films were adaptations of important novels, often depicting a \u201cheroic quest,\" as in Moby Dick, or The Red Badge of Courage. In many films, different groups of people, while struggling toward a common goal, would become doomed or \"destructive alliances,\u201d giving the films a dramatic and visual tension. Many of his themes also involved some of the \"grand narratives\" of the twentieth century, such as religion, meaning, truth, freedom, psychology, colonialism and war.\n\nBefore becoming a Hollywood filmmaker, he had been an amateur boxer, reporter, short-story writer, portrait artist in Paris, a cavalry rider in Mexico, and a documentary filmmaker during World War II. Huston has been referred to as \"a titan,\" \"a rebel\" and a \"renaissance man,\" in the Hollywood film industry. Author Ian Freer describes him as \"cinema's Ernest Hemingway,\" \u2014 a filmmaker who was \"never afraid to tackle tough issues head on.\"  A statue of Huston, sitting in his directorial chair (pictured below), stands in Plaza John Huston Puerto Vallarta in Mexico.

Cl\u00e9ment studied architecture at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts where he developed an interest in filmmaking. In 1936, he directed his first film, a 20 minute short written and featuring Jacques Tati. Cl\u00e9ment spent the latter part of the 1930s making documentaries in parts of the Middle East and Africa. In 1937, he and archaeologist Jules Barthou were in Yemen making preparations to film a documentary, the first ever of that country and one that includes the only known film image of Imam Yahya. Almost ten years passed before Cl\u00e9ment directed a feature but his French Resistance film, La Bataille du rail (1945), gained much critical and commercial success. From there Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment became one of his country's most successful and respected directors, garnering numerous awards including two films that won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, the first in 1950 for The Walls of Malapaga (Au-del\u00e0 des grilles) and the second time two years later for Forbidden Games (Jeux interdits). Cl\u00e9ment had international success with several films but his star-studded 1966 epic Is Paris Burning?, written by Gore Vidal and Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Paul Graetz was a costly box office failure. Cl\u00e9ment continued to make a few films until his retirement in 1975, including an international success with Rider On The Rain that starred Charles Bronson and Marl\u00e8ne Jobert. In 1984 the French motion picture industry honored his lifetime contribution to film with a special C\u00e9sar Award. Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment died in 1996 and was buried in the local cemetery in Menton on the French Riviera where he had spent his years in retirement.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He directed several award-winning films, including The Sheep Thief (1997), winner of the 2nd Prize Cin\u00e9fondation for Short Film at the Cannes Film Festival, The Warrior (2001), which won the BAFTA Award for Best British Film and Senna (2010), winner of the World Cinema Audience Award Documentary at the Sundance Film Festival 2011.\n\nBAFTA award winning filmmaker Asif Kapadia is known for his visually striking films which explore the lives of \u2018outsiders\u2019, characters living in timeless, extreme and unforgiving circumstances or landscapes. His films have been awarded and distributed internationally and shown how versatile and expressive British cinema can be.\n\nBorn in Hackney, London in 1972, Kapadia studied filmmaking at the Royal College of Art where he first gained recognition with his short The Sheep Thief (1997) telling the story of a gifted street kid and the family who take him in, made with non professional actors in Rajasthan, India, the film won many awards including Second Prize at the 1998 Cannes International Film Festival Cinefondation, the Grand Prix at the 1997 European Short Film Festival in Brest &amp; Best Director at the Recontres Henri Langlois Festival International des Ecoles de Cinema in Poitiers 1997.\n\nKapadia\u2019s distinct visual style continued with his first feature The Warrior (2001, FilmFour), shot in the deserts of Rajasthan and the snow capped Himalaya. The Warrior was championed in the British Press as \u2018epic\u2019and \u2018stunning\u2019 (Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian) and was nominated for three BAFTA awards, winning two the Alexander Korda Award for the outstanding British Film of the Year 2002 and The Carl Foreman Award for Special Achievement by a Director, Screenwriter or Producer in their First Feature.\n\nThe Warrior also won the Grand Prix at the Dinard Film Festival, the prestigious Sutherland Award at the London Film Festival, the Evening Standard British Film Awards for the Most Promising Newcomer, the Douglas Hickox Award for Best Debut Film and the Technical Achievement Award for Cinematography at the British Independent Film Awards and the Jury Prize for the best cinematography at the San Sebastian Film Festival.\n\nFar North (2007, FILM4), premiered at the Venice Film Festival, based on a dark short story by Sara Maitland. Kapadia used the epic and brutal arctic landscape to show how desperation and loneliness drive a woman to harm the person she loves the most.\n\nKapadia's fourth feature Senna, (2010, Working Title / Universal Pictures) the epic story of the monumental life and tragic death of legendary Brazilian motor-racing Champion, Ayrton Senna. Spanning the decade from his arrival in Formula One in the mid 80\u2019s, the film follows Senna\u2019s struggles both on track against his nemesis, French World Champion Alain Prost, and off it, against the politics which infest the sport. Sublime, spiritual and, on occasion, ruthless \u2013 Ayrton Senna conquers and transcends Formula One to become a global superstar. Privately, he is humble and fiercely patriotic, donating millions to his native Brasil and contemplating a life beyond racing. Tragically he is struck down in his prime on the blackest weekend in the history of the sport, watched live on television by 300 million people. Years on he is revered in Formula One as the greatest motor racing driver of all time \u2013 and in Brasil as a Saint.\n\nWinner of the World Cinema Audience Award Documentary at the Sundance Film Festival 2011\n\nKapadia on accepting the award; \"This is amazing. This festival has restored my faith in film festivals, Sundance is all about the films, the audience and the film makers. Every single screening is sold out. We were told that no one in the US knew who Ayrton Senna was, that there was no interest in Formula One, that we should forget about releasing the film here, so to win the Audience Award at Sundance is just fantastic, it makes us feel so proud. We hope this shows that there is an audience for SENNA in the US, both fans and people who have never heard of him before and I hope this is just the beginning of a long journey for SENNA in 2011.\u201d\n\nWinner of Best Documentary \u2013 Audience Award at the Adelaide Film Festival 2011\n\nSenna has been released in Japan and in Brazil where it had one of the biggest openings for a documentary film ever.\n\nThe film will be released in UK, Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Australia, S.

He has both written and directed Two Weeks Notice (2002), Music and Lyrics (2007), and most recently, Did You Hear About the Morgans? (2009), all starring Hugh Grant. A good way of getting an insight into Marc Lawrence's iterative approach to screenwriting and production is to play the relevant \"extras\" on the DVDs of some of the aforementioned movies. These commentaries demonstrate interesting insights into the productive nature of the interaction between actors, producers, director and screenwriter, and Mr Lawrence is quick to commend the impromptu, unscripted contributions of others.

His influential body of work dealt with bleakness and despair as well as comedy and hope. Described by Woody Allen as \"probably the greatest film artist, all things considered, since the invention of the motion picture camera\", he is recognized as one of the most accomplished and influential film directors of all time. However, despite critical acclaim, his films rarely earned large grosses or gained wide audiences.\n\nHe directed over sixty films and documentaries for cinematic release and for television, most of which he also wrote, and directed over one hundred and seventy plays. Among his company of actors were Liv Ullmann, Bibi Andersson, Erland Josephson, Ingrid Thulin and Max von Sydow. Most of his films were set in the landscape of Sweden. His major subjects were death, illness, faith, betrayal, and insanity.\n\nBergman was active for more than six decades. In 1976 his career was seriously threatened as the result of a botched criminal investigation for alleged income tax evasion. Outraged, Bergman suspended a number of pending productions, closed his studios, and went into self-imposed exile in Germany for eight years.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Ingmar Bergman, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.\u200b",

In the 1970s, he established an alternative to mainstream animation through independent and adult-oriented productions. Between 1972 and 1992, he directed nine theatrically released feature films, five of which he wrote. He has been involved in numerous television projects as director, writer, producer and animator.\n\nBeginning his career at the Terrytoons television cartoon studio as a cel polisher, Bakshi was eventually promoted to director. He moved to the animation division of Paramount Pictures in 1967 and started his own studio, Bakshi Productions, in 1968. Through producer Steve Krantz, Bakshi made his debut feature film, Fritz the Cat, released in 1972. It was the first animated film to receive an X rating from the Motion Picture Association of America, and the most successful independent animated feature of all time.\n\nOver the next eleven years, Bakshi directed seven additional animated features. He is well known for his fantasy films, which include Wizards (1977), The Lord of the Rings (1978) and Fire and Ice (1983). In 1987, Bakshi returned to television work, producing the series Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures, which ran for two years before it was canceled due to complaints from a conservative political group over perceived drug references. After a nine-year hiatus from feature films, he directed Cool World (1992), which was largely rewritten during production and received poor reviews. Bakshi returned to television with the live-action film Cool and the Crazy (1994) and the anthology series Spicy City (1997).\n\nHe founded the Bakshi School of Animation and Cartooning in 2003. During the 2000s, he has focused largely on painting. He has received several awards for his work, including the 1980 Golden Gryphon for The Lord of the Rings at the Giffoni Film Festival, the 1988 Annie Award for Distinguished Contribution to the Art of Animation, and the 2003 Maverick Tribute Award at the Cinequest Film Festival.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Ralph Bakshi, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

While working in Sweden he met Arlene Klasky, an American-born animator. The two subsequently started their own company, Klasky Csupo, which produced many popular animated television shows. He was credited as \"animation executive producer\" and \"supervising animation director\" for several episodes of The Simpsons[4] in the early seasons before the show switched over to Film Roman.\n\nHis record label, Tone Casualties, founded in 1994, released several industrial, noise, ambient and experimental music releases, including discs by Holger Czukay, Drew Neumann, Paul Sch\u00fctze, Kuroi Mori, Borut Kr\u017ei\u0161nik, Wahorn, Controlled Bleeding and his own works.\n\nHe also directed two live action films outside of Klasky Csupo: Bridge to Terabithia for Walt Disney Pictures, and The Secret of Moonacre for Warner Bros. and Lionsgate.\n\nThe character design of Dr. Nick Riviera (from The Simpsons) is based somewhat on Csup\u00f3.

As a young man, Hopper became interested in acting and eventually became a student of the Actors' Studio. He made his first television appearance in 1954, and appeared in two films featuring James Dean, Rebel Without a Cause (1955) and Giant (1956). During the next 10 years, Hopper appeared frequently on television in guest roles, and by the end of the 1960s had played supporting roles in several films. He directed and starred in Easy Rider (1969), winning an award at the Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay as co-writer. \"With its portrait of counterculture heroes raising their middle fingers to the uptight middle-class hypocrisies, Easy Rider became the cinematic symbol of the 1960s, a celluloid anthem to freedom, macho bravado and anti-establishment rebellion.\" Film critic Matthew Hays notes that \"no other persona better signifies the lost idealism of the 1960s than that of Dennis Hopper.\" He was unable to build on his success for several years, until a featured role in Apocalypse Now (1979) brought him attention. He subsequently appeared in Rumble Fish (1983) and The Osterman Weekend (1983), and received critical recognition for his work in Blue Velvet and Hoosiers, with the latter film garnering him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He directed Colors (1988) and played the villain in Speed (1994). Hopper's later work included a leading role in the television series Crash. Hopper's last performance was filmed just before his death: The Last Film Festival, slated for a 2011 release. Hopper was also a prolific and acclaimed photographer, a profession he began in the 1960s.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article\u00a0Dennis Hopper, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "It might have been easy to write off American actor Warren Beatty as merely the younger brother of film star Shirley MacLaine, were it not for the fact that Beatty was a profoundly gifted performer whose creative range extended beyond mere acting. After studying at Northwestern University and with acting coach Stella_Adler, Beatty was being groomed for stardom almost before he was of voting age, cast in prominent supporting roles in TV dramas and attaining the recurring part of the insufferable Milton Armitage on the TV sitcom Dobie Gillis. Beatty left Dobie after a handful of episodes, writing off his part as \"ridiculous,\" and headed for the stage, where he appeared in a stock production of +Compulsion and in William Inge's Broadway play +A Loss of Roses.\n\nThe actor's auspicious film debut occurred in Splendor in the Grass (1961), after which he spent a number of years being written off by the more narrow-minded movie critics as a would-be Brando. Both Beatty and his fans knew that there was more to his skill than that, and in 1965 Beatty sank a lot of his energy and money into a quirky, impressionistic crime drama, Mickey_One (1965). The film was a critical success but failed to secure top bookings, though its teaming of Beatty with director Arthur_Penn proved crucial to the shape of movie-making in the 1960s. With Penn again in the director's chair, Beatty took on his first film as producer/star, Bonnie and Clyde (1967). Once more, critics were hostile -- at first. A liberal amount of praise from fellow filmmakers and the word-of-mouth buzz from film fans turned Bonnie and Clyde into the most significant film of 1967 -- and compelled many critics to reverse their initial opinions and issue apologies. This isn't the place to analyze the value and influence Bonnie and Clyde had; suffice it to say that this one film propelled Warren Beatty from a handsome, talented film star into a powerful filmmaker.\n\nPicking and choosing his next projects very carefully, Beatty was offscreen as much as on from 1970 through 1975, though several of his projects -- most prominently McCabe and Mrs. Miller (1971) and The_Parallax_View (1974) -- would be greeted with effusive praise by film critics and historians. In 1975, Beatty wrote his first screenplay, and the result was Shampoo (1975), a trenchant satire on the misguided mores of the late '60s. Beatty turned director for 1978's Heaven_Can_Wait, a delightful remake of Here_Comes_Mr._Jordan that was successful enough to encourage future Hollywood bankrolling of Beatty's directorial efforts. In 1981, Beatty produced, directed, co-scripted and acted in Reds, a spectacular recounting of the Russian Revolution as seen through the eyes of American Communist John Reed. It was a pet project of Beatty's, one he'd been trying to finance since the 1970s (at that time, he'd intended to have Sergei_Bondarchuk of War and Peace fame as director). Reds failed to win a Best Picture Academy Award, though Beatty did pick up an Oscar as Best Director. Nothing Beatty has done since Reds has been without interest; refusing to turn out mere vehicles, he has taken on a benighted attempt to re-spark the spirit of the old Hope-Crosby road movies (Ishtar [1984]); brought a popular comic strip to the screen, complete with primary colors and artistic hyperbole (Dick_Tracy [1991]); and managed to make the ruthless gangster Bugsy Siegel a sympathetic visionary (Bugsy [1992]). In 1998 he was able to breath new life into political satire with Bulworth, his much acclaimed film in which he plays a disillusioned politician who turns to rap to express himself. In 2001, Beatty rekindled memories of Ishtar as he starred in another phenomenal bust, Town &amp; Country. Budgeted at an astronomical 90 million dollars and earning a miserable 6.7 million dollars during it's brief theatrical run, Town &amp; Country was released three years after completion and pulled from theaters after a mere four weeks, moving critics to rank it among the biggest flops in movie history.\n\nFiercely protective of his private life, and so much an advocate of total control that he will dictate the type of film stock and lighting to be used when being interviewed for television, Beatty has nonetheless had no luck at all in keeping his many amours out of the tabloids. However, Beatty's long and well-documented history of high-profile romances with such actresses as Leslie_Caron, Julie_Christie, Diane_Keaton, and Madonna came to an abrupt end upon his 1992 marriage to Bugsy co-star Annette_Bening, with whom he later starred in 1994's Love_Affair, his blighted remake of the 1957 An Affair to Remember.",

Growing up in North Bergen, New Jersey, Brooks endured a fractured family life and passed the time by reading and writing. After dropping out of New York University, he got a job as an usher at CBS, going on to write for the CBS News broadcasts. He moved to Los Angeles in 1965 to work on David L. Wolper's documentaries. After being laid off he met producer Allan Burns who secured him a job as a writer on the series My Mother the Car.\n\nBrooks wrote for several shows before being hired as a story editor on My Friend Tony and later creating the series Room 222. Grant Tinker hired Brooks and Burns at MTM Productions to create The Mary Tyler Moore Show in 1970. The show, one of the first to feature an independent working woman as its lead character, was critically acclaimed and won Brooks several Primetime Emmy Awards. Brooks and Burns then created two successful spin-offs from Mary Tyler Moore in the shape of Rhoda (a comedy) and Lou Grant (a drama). Brooks left MTM Productions in 1978 to co-create the sitcom Taxi which, despite winning multiple Emmys, suffered from low ratings and was canceled twice.\n\nHe moved into feature film work when he wrote and co-produced the 1979 film Starting Over. His next project was the critically acclaimed film Terms of Endearment, which he produced, directed and wrote, winning an Academy Award for all three positions. Basing his next film, Broadcast News, on his journalistic experiences the film earned him a further two Academy Award nominations. Although his 1994 work I'll Do Anything was hampered by negative press attention due to the cutting of all of its recorded musical numbers, As Good as It Gets (co-written with Mark Andrus) earned further praise. It was seven years until his next film, which came in the shape of 2004's Spanglish. His sixth film, How Do You Know, was released in 2010. Brooks also produced and mentored Cameron Crowe on Say Anything... (1989) and Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson on Bottle Rocket (1996).\n\nAlthough he did not intend to do so, Brooks returned to television in 1987 as the producer of The Tracey Ullman Show. He hired cartoonist Matt Groening to create a series of shorts for the show, which eventually led to The Simpsons in 1989. The Simpsons won numerous awards and is still running after 20 years. Brooks also co-produced and co-wrote the 2007 film adaptation of the show, The Simpsons Movie. In total, Brooks has received 47 Emmy nominations, winning 20 of them.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article James L.

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.  Norman Foster (December 13, 1903 - July 7, 1976) was an American film director and actor.\n\nBorn John Hoeffer in Richmond, Indiana, Foster originally became a cub reporter on a local newspaper in Indiana before going to New York in the hopes of getting a better newspaper job but there were no vacancies. He tried a number of theatrical agencies before getting stage work and later appeared on Broadway in the George S. Kaufman / Ring Lardner play June Moon in 1929. He has also acted in London, England.\n\nHe started working in crowd scenes in films before moving to bigger parts. His film acting credits include Prosperity (1932), Pilgrimage (1933), Rafter Romance (1933) with Ginger Rogers and State Fair (1933). He has written several plays. He gave up acting in the late 1930s to pursue directing, although he occasionally appeared in movies and television programs.\n\nSome of Foster's directorial efforts include The Sign of Zorro (1958), and the stylish films noir Kiss the Blood Off My Hands (1948), Woman on the Run (1950) and Journey into Fear (1943). Foster directed Rachel and the Stranger and the Davy Crockett segments of Disneyland that were edited into feature films Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier and Davy Crockett and the River Pirates where he did not accept any interference from Walt Disney.\n\nIn 1967, he directed Brighty of the Grand Canyon, based on a children's novel by Marguerite Henry about a burro in the Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona. The film starred Joseph Cotten, Karl Swenson, Dick Foran, and Pat Conway.\n\nIt was rumored that Orson Welles took over direction of Journey Into Fear, which Welles later denied. Foster was the director of the \"My Friend Bonito\" segment of Orson Welles' Pan-American anthology film It's All True until RKO aborted the project.\n\nFoster directed a number of Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto mysteries, including Charlie Chan in Panama (1940), Charlie Chan at Treasure Island (1939), Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation (1939), Charlie Chan in Reno (1939), Mr. Moto's Last Warning (1939), Mysterious Mr. Moto (1938), Mr. Moto Takes a Chance (1938), Thank You, Mr. Moto (1937), and Think Fast, Mr. Moto (1937).\n\nFoster was married to Claudette Colbert from 1928 until their divorce in 1935. In 1937, he wed actress Sally Blane, an older sister of Loretta Young. The couple remained married until his death in 1976 from cancer in Santa Monica at the age of 75. They had two children, Robert and Gretchen.\n\nHe is buried in Culver City's Holy Cross Cemetery.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Norman Foster, licensed under CC-BY-SA,full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

His parents encouraged him to leave school and pursue his acting goals rather than be unhappy. McGregor studied drama for a year at Kirkcaldly in Fife, then enrolled at London's Guildhall School of Music and Drama for a three-year course. He studied alongside Daniel Craig and Alistair McGowan among others, and left right before graduating after snagging the role of Private Mick Hopper in Dennis Potter's 1993 six-part Channel 4 series \"Lipstick on Your Collar\" (1993).\n\nHis first notable role was that of Alex Law in Shallow Grave (1994), directed by Danny Boyle, written by John Hodge and produced by Andrew MacDonald. This was followed by The Pillow Book (1996) and Trainspotting (1996), the latter of which brought him to the public's attention.\n\nHe is now one of the most critically acclaimed actors of his generation, and portrays Obi-wan Kenobi in the first three Star Wars episodes. McGregor is married to French production designer Eve Mavrakis, whom he met while working on the TV show \"Kavanagh QC\" (1995). They married in France in the summer of 1995 and have two daughters, Clara Mathilde and Esther Rose. McGregor has formed a production company with friends Jonny Lee Miller, Sean Pertwee, Jude Law and Sadie Frost.

His latest film, \"The Ledge,\" which he wrote and directed, stars Charlie Hunnam, Liv Tyler, Terence Howard, and Patrick Wilson. It was shot in Louisiana in spring 2010 and was accepted into the main (U.S. Dramatic) competition at Sundance 2011. Bought by IFC, it will have its theatrical release in the U.S. in early summer. The film deals with an intellectual, personal, and ultimately fatal feud between an atheist and an evangelical Christian.\n\nMatthew Chapman's mother Clare was the daughter of the philosophy professor and author Francis Cornford and poet Frances Cornford (n\u00e9e Darwin), and through his maternal grandmother he is a great-great grandson of Charles Darwin. His father, Cecil Chapman, was the son of the noted physicist and astronomer, Sydney Chapman, responsible for early research on the nature of the ozone layer.\n\nChapman has written widely on the creation-evolution controversy in the US, particularly the case of Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, in which 11 parents successfully sued the school district to prevent them from reading a required statement aloud in ninth-grade science classes whenever evolution was taught.\n\nHe has written and directed six films, written numerous screenplays, had articles published in Harper's magazine, and is the author of two books, \"Trials Of The Monkey - An Accidental Memoir\" and \"40 Days and 40 Nights - Darwin, Intelligent Design, God, OxyContin, and Other Oddities on Trial in Pennsylvania\" He is married to documentary film producer, Denise Dummont, with whom he has a daughter, Anna Bella Charles Darwin Teixeira Chapman, and a stepson, Diogo Marzo.\n\nMatthew Chapman founded Science Debate 2008 (now simply Science Debate). His co-founders were fellow screenwriter Shawn Lawrence Otto, CEO of the organization, science writer Chris Mooney, marine biologist and science blogger Sheril Kirshenbaum, noted physicist Lawrence Krauss, and philosopher Austin Dacey. The organization was formed to pressure the presidential candidates to hold a debate on science and technology issues. Almost 40,000 people signed onto the website ScienceDebate2008.com in support of the idea, including many Nobel laureates, hundreds of universities, university presidents, dozens of science publications, business leaders and innovators, and practically every major science organization in America. Although the candidates did not agree to the two televised debates proposed by Science Debate 2008, both Obama and McCain did participate in an online written version, providing detailed responses to the \"14 Top Science Questions Facing America,\" a list suggested by the organization's members. Several of the earliest supporters of Science Debate are now in the Obama administration, including Energy Secretary Steven Chu, NOAA Director Jane Lubchenco, and Presidential Science Advisor John Holdren.

He has collaborated with major directors such as Stephen Frears (in the 1988 period drama Dangerous Liaisons); Gus Van Sant (in the 1991 independent film My Own Private Idaho); and Bernardo Bertolucci (in the 1993 film Little Buddha). Referring to his 1991 film releases, The New York Times' critic, Janet Maslin, praised Reeves' versatility, saying that he \"displays considerable discipline and range. He moves easily between the buttoned-down demeanor that suits a police procedural story and the loose-jointed manner of his comic roles.\" A repeated theme in roles he has portrayed is that of saving the world, including the characters of Ted Logan, Buddha, Neo, Johnny Mnemonic, John Constantine and Klaatu.",

His books have sold over 150 million copies worldwide, and many have been adapted into films. In 1994, Crichton became the only creative artist ever to have works simultaneously charting at #1 in television, film, and book sales (with ER, Jurassic Park, and Disclosure, respectively).\n\nHis literary works are usually based on the action genre and heavily feature technology. His novels epitomize the techno-thriller genre of literature, often exploring technology and failures of human interaction with it, especially resulting in catastrophes with biotechnology. Many of his future history novels have medical or scientific underpinnings, reflecting his medical training and science background. He was the author of, among others, Jurassic Park, The Andromeda Strain, Congo, Travels, Sphere, Rising Sun, Disclosure, The Lost World, Airframe, Timeline, Prey, State of Fear, Next (the final book published before his death), Pirate Latitudes (published November 24, 2009), and a final unfinished techno-thriller yet to be released.

After graduating, Gary moved to London, England, where he continued directing commercials and also co-wrote and directed his first feature film, Death Line starring Donald Pleasence. The British Film Institute called this debut \"The Most Significant Directorial Debut of the Year\".\n\nUpon relocating to Los Angeles, California, he continued writing and collaborating on many feature scripts. He also wrote and directed several television pilots. Avco-Embassy producer Ronald Shusett asked Sherman to direct the 1981 horror film Dead & Buried, and Sherman followed that film with the action-thriller Vice Squad shot by Stanley Kubrick's DP John Alcott. Like Death Line, these films often polarized critics and audiences and have since gone on to become genre classics.\n\nNext he co-wrote and directed the thriller Wanted: Dead or Alive starring Rutger Hauer and Gene Simmons.

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nArthur Hiller Penn  was an American film director and producer with a career as a theater director as well. Penn amassed a critically acclaimed body of work throughout the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nAfter making a name for himself as a director of quality television dramas, Penn made his feature debut with a western, The Left Handed Gun (1958). A retelling of the Billy the Kid legend, it was distinguished by Paul Newman's sharp portrayal of the outlaw as a psychologically troubled youth. Warner Brothers reedited the film against his wishes with a new ending he disapproved of. The film subsequently failed upon release in North America, but was well received in Europe.\n\nPenn's second film was The Miracle Worker (1962), the story of Anne Sullivan's struggle to teach the blind and deaf Helen Keller how to communicate. It garnered two Academy Awards for its leads Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke. Penn had won a Tony Award for directing the stage production, also starring Bancroft and Duke. \n\nIn 1965 Penn directed Mickey One. Heavily influenced by the French New Wave, it was the dreamlike story of a standup comedian (played by Warren Beatty) on the run from sinister, ambiguous forces. Penn's next film was The Chase (1966) a thriller following events in a small corrupt Southern town on the day an escaped convict, played by Robert Redford, returns. Although not a major success, The Chase nonetheless caught the mood of the turbulent times, a 'state of the nation' tale of racism and corruption. \n\nReuniting with Warren Beatty for the rural gangster film Bonnie and Clyde (1967), Penn perfectly caught the youthful disenchantment of the late '60s. It went on to become a worldwide phenomenon, at the same time pushing the limits of acceptable screen violence with its bloody machine-gun climax. The film was strongly influenced by the French New Wave and itself went on to make a huge impression on a younger generation of filmmakers. Indeed, there was a strong resurgence in the \"love on the run\" subgenre in the wake of Bonnie and Clyde, peaking with Badlands (1973).\n\nNext came Alice's Restaurant (1969), based on a satirical ballad by Arlo Guthrie. His next film after this was a return to the western genre, Little Big Man (1970), a \"shaggy dog\" account of the life of a white man (played by Dustin Hoffman) who gets adopted into the Cheyenne tribe. His next film was a paranoid thriller set in Los Angeles, Night Moves (1975) about a private detective (played by Gene Hackman) on the trail of a runaway. Next came a comic western, The Missouri Breaks (1976), a ramshackle, eccentric story of a horse thief (Jack Nicholson) facing off with an eccentric bounty hunter (played by Marlon Brando).\n\nIn the 1980s, Penn's career began to lose its momentum with critics and audiences: Four Friends (1981) was a traumatic look back at the Sixties. Next came Target (1985), a mainstream thriller reuniting the director with Gene Hackman, and Dead of Winter (1987) a horror/thriller in the style of Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nSubsequently, Penn returned to work in television, including an executive producer role for the crime series Law & Order.  Throughout the years, Penn had maintained an affiliation with Yale University, occasionally teaching classes there.\n\nDescription from the Wikipedia article Arthur Penn, licensed under CC-BY-SA.",

Best known for his avant-garde films, he has been \"venerated by cult cinema enthusiasts\" for his work which \"is filled with violently surreal images and a hybrid blend of mysticism and religious provocation.\" His most notable works include El Topo (1970), The Holy Mountain (1973) and Santa Sangre (1989), all of which have had limited release but achieved popularity amongst various countercultural groups. He has cited the filmmaker Federico Fellini as his primary cinematic influence, and has been described as an influence on such figures as Marilyn Manson and David Lynch. After a failed attempt to return to filmmaking with a film entitled King Shot starring Marilyn Manson and produced by David Lynch, Alejandro is set to return to cinema with the sequel to El Topo entitled Abel Cain sometime in late 2011 or 2012.\n\nJodorowsky is also a playwright and play director, having produced over one hundred plays, primarily in Mexico where he lived for much of his life. Alongside this he is also a writer, particularly of comic books - his The Incal even has been noted as having a claim to be \"the best comic book\" ever written - as well as books on his own theories about spirituality. Jodorowsky has been involved in the occult and various spiritual and religious groups, including Zen Buddhism and forms of Mexican shamanism, and has formulated his own spiritual system, which he has called \"psychomagic\" and \"psychoshamanism\".\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Alejandro Jodorowsky, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

His skewed vision of the world was apparent at an early age in Super 8mm epics like Dr. Griffin's Creation and Starflight 7.\n\nAfter graduating from the film program at SUNY Purchase, Turner soon immersed himself in the world of feature and commercial production in New York and Los Angeles. Memorable events from this time include a disastrous stint as a pigeon wrangler on a shoot for commercial director Steve Horn and working as a production assistant on several low budget films including Anthony Hickox's Warlock: The Armageddon. Turner eventually began directing music videos and made the transition to directing commercials for clients including McDonald's, General Electric and Quaker State.\n\nAlex's short film Chuck has screened in over thirty film festivals. It was featured on the Sci-Fi Channel, and won the Rod Serling award at the 2001 Long Island Film Festival. Turner's second short film, Disposal, starring JK Simmons, can be seen on IFC and was shown as part of LACMA's 2004 Young Directors Night.\n\nDead Birds, Turner's first feature, starring Henry Thomas, Isaiah Washington and Patrick Fugit, premiered at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nIn 2009 Turner returned to the genre with Red Sands, a psychological thriller starring Shane West, Aldis Hodge, Leonard Roberts, Callum Blue, JK Simmons, Theo Rossi and Noel Gugliemi as US soldiers serving in Afghanistan just after the 2001 US invasion.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Alex Turner, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He became the first foreigner to operate an Aikido Dojo in Japan.\n\nHe later moved to the Los Angeles, California, area where he made his film debut in 1988 in Above the Law. By 1991, he had starred in three successful films, and would go on to achieve greater fame in Under Siege (1992), where he played Navy SEALs counter-terrorist expert Casey Ryback. However, his image became tarnished when both On Deadly Ground (1994, which he directed) and Under Siege 2: Dark Territory (1995) did poorly in theaters. During the later half of the 90s, he starred in three more theatrical films and a direct-to-video The Patriot. Aside from Exit Wounds (2001) and Half Past Dead (2002), his career shifted almost entirely to direct-to-video films (often low budget productions and shot in Europe or Asia). Between 1998 to 2009, he appeared in a total of 22 of these. At the age of 59, he finally returned to the big screen as Torrez in the 2010 film Machete. As of 2011, he's currently busy with the third season of his reality show Steven Seagal: Lawman.\n\nSeagal is also a recording artist and guitarist and the founder of Steven Seagal Enterprises. In addition to his professional achievements, he is also known as an environmentalist, an animal rights activist and a supporter of the 14th Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso, and the Tibetan independence movement.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Steven Seagal, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

He is best remembered for his work in the thriller film genre, having directed The Wages of Fear and Les Diaboliques, which are critically recognized to be among the greatest films from the 1950s. Clouzot also directed documentary films, including The Mystery of Picasso, which was declared a national treasure by the government of France.\n\nClouzot was an early fan of the cinema and, desiring a career as a writer, moved to Paris. He was later hired by producer Adolphe Osso to work in Berlin, writing French-language versions of German films. After being fired from German studios due to his friendship with Jewish producers, Clouzot returned to France, where he spent years bedridden after contracting tuberculosis. Upon recovering, Clouzot found work in Nazi occupied France as a screenwriter for the German-owned company Continental Films. At Continental, Clouzot wrote and directed films that were very popular in France. His second film Le Corbeau drew controversy over its harsh look at provincial France and Clouzot was fired from Continental before its release. As a result of his association with Continental, Clouzot was barred by the French government from filmmaking until 1947.\n\nAfter the ban was lifted, Clouzot reestablished his reputation and popularity in France during the late 1940s with successful films including Quai des Orf\u00e8vres. After the release of his comedy film Miquette et sa m\u00e8re, Clouzot married V\u00e9ra Gibson-Amado, who would star in his next three feature films. In the early and mid-1950s, Clouzot drew acclaim from international critics and audiences for The Wages of Fear and Diabolique. Both films would serve as source material for remakes decades later. After the release of La V\u00e9rit\u00e9, Clouzot's wife V\u00e9ra died of a heart attack and Clouzot's career suffered due to depression, illness and new critical views of films from the French New Wave. Clouzot's career became less active in later years, limited to a few television documentaries and two feature films in the 1960s. Clouzot wrote several unused scripts in the 1970s and died in Paris in 1977.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Henri-Georges Clouzot, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

        "biography": "Ren\u00e9 Clair was a French filmmaker and writer. He first established his reputation in the 1920s as a director of silent films in which comedy was often mingled with fantasy. He went on to make some of the most innovative early sound films in France, before going abroad to work in the UK and USA for more than a decade. Returning to France after World War II, he continued to make films that were characterised by their elegance and wit, often presenting a nostalgic view of French life in earlier years. He was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in 1960. Clair's best known films include The Italian Straw Hat (1928), Under the Roofs of Paris (1930), Le Million (1931), \u00c0 nous la libert\u00e9 (1931), I Married a Witch (1942), and And Then There Were None (1945).\n\nIn 1924, while Clair was working on Cin\u00e9-sketch for the theatre with France Picabia, he first met a young actress, Bronja Perlmutter, who subsequently appeared in his film Le Voyage imaginaire (1926) premiered at the newly opened Studio des Ursulines. They married in 1926, and their son, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois, was born in 1927. \n\nRen\u00e9 Clair died at home on 15 March 1981, and he was buried privately at Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois.\n\nClair's reputation as a film-maker underwent a considerable reevaluation during the course of his own lifetime: in the 1930s he was widely seen as one of France's greatest directors, alongside Renoir and Carn\u00e9, but thereafter his work's artifice and detachment from the realities of life fell increasingly from favour. The avant-gardism of his first films, and especially Entr'acte, had given him a temporary notoriety, and a grounding in surrealism continued to underlie much of his comedy work. It was however the imaginative manner in which he overcame his initial scepticism about the arrival of sound which established his originality, and his first four sound films brought him international fame.\n\nClair's years of working in the UK and USA made him still more widely known but did not show any marked development in his style or thematic concerns. It was in the post-war films that he made on his return to France that some critics have observed a new maturity and emotional depth, accompanied by a prevailing sense of melancholy but still framed by the elegance and wit that characterised his earlier work.\n\nHowever, in the 1950s the critics who heralded the arrival of the French New Wave, especially those associated with Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma, found Clair's work old-fashioned and academic. The paradox of Clair's reputation has been further heightened by those commentators who have seen Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut as the French cinema's true successor to Clair, notwithstanding the occasions of their mutual disdain.",

Chicago Tribune film critic Roger Ebert, in his review of the movie, called it \"an extraordinary documentary about what happened next, as a town banded together to stop what folks saw as a miscarriage of justice.\"\n\nHe graduated from Colgate University in 1983. He lives with his wife and daughters in New York.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Joe Berlinger, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

(born November 21, 1935) is an American cinematographer whose prominence owes most to his innovative work of the 1970s and 1980s. He began his career as a camera operator, distinguishing himself on Steven Spielberg's Jaws. As a cinematographer, he became famous for his two collaborations with Martin Scorsese, Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. Chapman was also cinematographer for the 1978 remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Chapman's style tends towards high contrasts and aggressive use of strong colors. He is also extremely adept at setting up complex camera movements quickly and improvising on the set. This style is epitomized in the boxing sequences in Raging Bull, during which the camera was often strapped to the actors through improvised rigs. Chapman was also the principal cinematographer on Scorsese's documentary The Last Waltz. Besides his work with Scorsese, Chapman has worked as Director of Photography for directors Hal Ashby, Philip Kaufman, Martin Ritt, Robert Towne, Michael Caton-Jones, Andrew Davis, and Ivan Reitman. He occasionally makes cameos in films he shoots. He has directed several films, the best known being All the Right Moves (1983), starring Tom Cruise in one of that actor's breakthrough roles. His most recent film was Bridge to Terabithia. According to the DVD commentary, Chapman was planning to retire after the film was finished, saying he would have the last film he shot be a good one.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Michael Chapman (cinematographer), licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Forsyth first came to attention with a low-budget film, That Sinking Feeling, made with youth theatre actors and featuring a cameo appearance by the Edinburgh gallery owner Richard Demarco. The relative success of the film was carried to a far higher level by his next film Gregory's Girl in 1981. This featured some of the same young actors, in particular John Gordon Sinclair, as well as the acting debut of Clare Grogan. The film was a major hit and won 'Best Screenplay' in that year's BAFTA Awards. In 1983 he wrote and directed the successful Local Hero, produced by David Puttnam, and featuring Burt Lancaster. It was rated in the top 100 films of the 1980s in a Premiere magazine recap of the decade. Forsyth's next film was the 1984 Comfort and Joy, about a Glasgow radio DJ caught between rival ice cream companies, which again featured Clare Grogan. When Puttnam went to Hollywood, Forsyth followed, but had limited success. The 1987 Housekeeping was his first American film. Another movie, Being Human, was shelved by the studio for four years after Puttnam was ousted. Gregory's Two Girls from 2000 appeared as a sequel to Gregory's Girl, with John Gordon Sinclair playing the same character, but it received mixed reviews. In a June 2009 interview on BBC Radio 5 Live, Forsyth stated that he is currently working on a new film project with the working title of Exile.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Bill Forsyth, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Critic Roger Ebert wrote of Keaton's \"extraordinary period from 1920 to 1929, [when] he worked without interruption on a series of films that make him, arguably, the greatest actor-director in the history of the movies.\"Orson Welles stated that Keaton's The General is the greatest comedy ever made, the greatest Civil War film ever made, and perhaps the greatest film ever made. A 2002 worldwide poll by Sight & Sound ranked Keaton's The General as the 15th best film of all time. Three other Keaton films received votes in the magazine's survey: Our Hospitality, Sherlock, Jr., and The Navigator.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Buster Keaton, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "Jean Renoir was a French film director, screenwriter, actor, producer and author. As a film director and actor, he made more than forty films from the silent era to the end of the 1960s. As an author, he wrote the definitive biography of his father, the painter, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Renoir, My Father (1962).\n\nDuring the 1930s Renoir enjoyed great success as a filmmaker. In 1931 he directed his first sound films, On purge b\u00e9b\u00e9 and La Chienne (The Bitch). The following year he made Boudu Saved From Drowning (Boudu sauv\u00e9 des eaux), a farcical sendup of the pretensions of a middle-class bookseller and his family, who meet with comic, and ultimately disastrous, results when they attempt to reform a vagrant played by Michel Simon.\n\nBy the middle of the decade Renoir was associated with the Popular Front, and several of his films, such as The Crime of Monsieur Lange (Le Crime de Monsieur Lange, 1935), La Vie Est a Nous (People of France) (1936) and La Marseillaise (1938), reflect the movement's politics. In 1937 he made one of his most well-known films, Grand Illusion (La Grande Illusion), starring Erich von Stroheim and the immensely popular Jean Gabin. A film on the theme of brotherhood about a series of escape attempts by French POWs during World War I, it was enormously successful but was also banned in Germany, and later in Italy after having won the \"Best Artistic Ensemble\" award at the Venice Film Festival. This was followed by another cinematic success: The Human Beast (La B\u00eate Humaine) (1938), a film noir tragedy based on the novel by \u00c9mile Zola and starring Simone Simon and Jean Gabin.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nKenneth Johnson (born 26 October 1942) is an American screenwriter, producer and director best known as the creator of the V science fiction franchise and The Incredible Hulk TV series. His creative efforts are almost entirely concentrated in the area of television science fiction.\n\nA native of Pine Bluff, Arkansas, Johnson is a graduate of the Carnegie Institute of Technology. His early TV work includes The Six Million Dollar Man, The Bionic Woman and The Incredible Hulk. Johnson created the character of Jaime Sommers and the Bionic Woman series.\n\nIn 1983, he wrote and directed the original miniseries V, about an invasion of Earth by reptilian aliens. The miniseries aired on NBC, and a year later was followed by a sequel, V: The Final Battle, which Johnson briefly worked on before leaving the project due to disagreements with the network. Johnson was subsequently credited as a co-writer of the sequel miniseries under the pseudonym Lillian Weezer, and was not involved at all in the weekly V television series that followed.\n\nIn 1989, he produced the television series Alien Nation based on the 1988 film of the same name.\n\nIn 1997, he wrote and directed the movie Steel, based on the DC comic book character Steel. It featured basketball player Shaquille O'Neal as John Henry Irons, the character's alter-ego.\n\nIn 2006, Johnson announced his completion of a four hour script for a new V mini series called V: The Second Generation. The storyline takes place 20 years after the original 1983 mini-series, ignoring the second mini-series (V: The Final Battle) and subsequent weekly television series. However, NBC told Johnson that they were more interested in a remake of the original V mini-series instead, which, if successful, might lead to his proposed sequel.\n\nSince then, Johnson adapted his screenplay for V: The Second Generation into a novel. It was published by Tor Books and released on February 5, 2008. However, since his discussions with NBC, Warner Bros (who hold the television rights to the V franchise) have opted to produce a remake of V (written by Scott Peters) for the ABC Network, thus ending any prospect of Johnson's sequel being produced for television.\n\nIn April 2008, Johnson stated his intention to remake the original V mini-series and his new sequel V: The Second Generation into feature films. Johnson claimed to have been in discussions with producers interested in the project, though was extremely vague:\n\n\"... since I own the motion picture rights to V, we\u2019re in the process to do a remake of the original mini-series first as a theatrical feature, which I\u2019m so jazzed about because it will give me an opportunity to really realize it and execute it in a way that was impossible to do back then. Then that will lead to the obvious sequel, because it is a franchise, and then we\u2019ll get into The Second Generation and I'm hoping we\u2019ll be able to do two movies, because there\u2019s certainly enough material in the novel to warrant two separate sequels. That\u2019s my goal at this point and that\u2019s what we\u2019re in the process of doing. I just literally came from a meeting, 15\u201320 minutes ago with a fellow in Beverly Hills who really says that we\u2019re gonna do it.\"\n\nHowever, since this statement, Johnson's potential film production has not been developed further, whilst Warner Bros' television remake for ABC premiered on November 3, 2009.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Kenneth Johnson (producer), licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

Has two brothers, an older brother Fernando Risi (1890-?) a cinematographer and a younger brother, Nelo Risi (1920-) a director and writer.\n\nAt the age of twelve, Risi became an orphan and was looked after by relatives and friends of his family. He studied medicine and later became a psychiatrist.\n\nRisi started his career in cinema as an assistant director to cinema figures such as Mario Soldati and Alberto Lattuada. Later he began directing his own films and was credited with giving early opportunities to future acting stars such as Sophia Loren and Vittorio Gassman. His 1966 film Treasure of San Gennaro was entered into the 5th Moscow International Film Festival where it won a Silver Prize.\n\nHis biggest hits were Poor, But Handsome (Poveri ma belli), followed by two sequels, which he also directed; A Difficult Life (Una vita difficile); The Easy Life (Il sorpasso); Opiate '67 or, in a cut version, 15 From Rome (I Mostri); and Scent Of A Woman (Profumo di Donna), which was remade by Martin Brest starring Al Pacino in 1992.\n\nIn 2002, he was awarded the Golden Lion \u2013 Honorary Award (Leone d'oro alla carriera) at the Venice Film Festival for his life-time work. Two of his films, Il gioved\u00ec and Il commissario Lo Gatto, were shown in a retrospective section on Italian comedy at the 67th Venice International Film Festival.\n\nHe died on 7 June 2008 at his residence in Rome. He was 91 and is survived by two children, Claudio and Marco (film director).[from Wikipedia]",

He is widely considered by many commentators, critics, media and other martial artists to be the most influential martial artist of modern times, and a cultural icon. Lee was born in San Francisco to parents of Hong Kong heritage but was raised in Hong Kong until his late teens. Lee emigrated to the United States at the age of 18 to claim his U.S. citizenship and receive his higher education. It was during this time that he began teaching martial arts, which soon led to film and television roles. His Hong Kong and Hollywood-produced films elevated the traditional Hong Kong martial arts film to a new level of popularity and acclaim, and sparked a major surge of interest in Chinese martial arts in the West in the 1970s. The direction and tone of his films changed and influenced martial arts and martial arts films in Hong Kong and the rest of the world, as well. He is noted for his roles in five feature-length films: Lo Wei's The Big Boss (1971) and Fist of Fury (1972); Way of the Dragon (1972), directed and written by Lee; Warner Brothers' Enter the Dragon (1973), directed by Robert Clouse; and Game of Death (1978), directed by Robert Clouse. Lee became an iconic figure known throughout the world, particularly among the Chinese, as he portrayed Chinese nationalism in his films. He initially trained in Wing Chun, but he later rejected well-defined martial art styles, favouring instead to utilise useful techniques from various sources in the spirit of his personal martial arts philosophy, which he dubbed Jeet Kune Do (The Way of the Intercepting Fist).\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Bruce Lee, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.\n\nSource: Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",

He began directing silent movies in 1917 and went on to helm 107 films, 40 of them silent. Although most of Neill's films were for the most part low-budget B-movies, he was known for directing films with meticulously lit scenes with carefully layered shadows that would become the style of film noir in the late 1940s. In fact, his last film, Black Angel (1946), is considered a film noir.\n\nHe was also credited in some works as R. William Neill, Roy W. Neill, and Roy Neill. Neill lived in the United States for most of his career and was a U.S. citizen. He did go to London from 1935 until 1940 where better opportunities existed for American directors. During this period, British film producer Edward Black hired Neill to direct The Lady Vanishes.

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nKristian Levring is a Danish director born in 1957 in Denmark. He was the fourth signatory of Dogme95. He lived eight years in France. He graduated in editing at the National Film School of Denmark and has edited a large number of documentaries and feature films besides directing two feature films, among these, Et skud fra hjertet (1986). He is the recipient of some 23 Danish and international awards for his commercials. The King is Alive (Dogme 4) is his third feature film. The King is Alive tells the story of a mixed group of tourists in Namibia, Africa, whose bus breaks down in a remote, abandoned village (formerly a mining town). Facing starvation, dehydration, cabin fever, and death, one of the group decides to stage a production of Shakespeare's King Lear and casts the others as characters. As the thin veneer of civilized behavior breaks down, the group experiences the absurdity of putting on a play (for no audience except one lone indigenous man) in such dire and fatal circumstances. Filmed in stark digital and adhering to the tenets of Dogme filmmaking, The King is Alive is a fascinating study in the dark heart of people under extreme stress. Herzogian in its theme and mood, the film's location (remote Namibia) is as much a character in the film as the actors, like the space ship in Ridley Scott's Alien. The King is Alive features Jennifer Jason-Leigh and Brion James (Blade Runner's \"Leon\"; Cabin Boy). Dark, tense, and desperate, it stands as a powerful piece of filmmaking. Levring's next film after The King is Alive is called The Intended and features some of the same actors from the former. Set in the jungle of Borneo in the 1920s, it concerns an isolated English settlement/ivory trading station. Similar in nature to The King is Alive, it focuses on what happens to small isolated groups under both internal psychological pressure and external pressure from the environment around them. As The King is Alive was filmed by Dogme rules and restrictions, The Intended instead has steady camera shots (rather than shaky/handheld) and ambient music throughout. Subtle yet powerful, the film explores Conradian contexts through the lens of a female perspective. Its influence can be seen in the Australian frontier film The Proposition.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Kristian Levring, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

One of the first filmmakers to use multiple exposures, time-lapse photography, tracking shots, dissolves, and hand-painted color in his work, M\u00e9li\u00e8s pioneered effects that would define cinematic special effects for decades to come. \u00a0A prolific innovator in the use of special effects, M\u00e9li\u00e8s accidentally discovered the substitution stop trick in 1896, a method of creating seamless disappearing and/or appearing effects used throughout both films and television for decades to come. \u00a0Because of his ability to seemingly manipulate and transform reality through cinematography, M\u00e9li\u00e8s is sometimes referred to as the first \"Cinemagician\".\n\nTwo of his best-known films are A Trip to the Moon (1902) and The Impossible Voyage (1904). Both stories involve strange, surreal voyages, somewhat in the style of Jules Verne, and are considered among the most important early science fiction films, though their approach is closer to fantasy. M\u00e9li\u00e8s was also an early pioneer of horror cinema, which can be traced back to his Le Manoir du diable (1896). \u00a0\n\nIn early 1909 M\u00e9li\u00e8s stopped making films to protest Thomas Edison's Motion Pictures Parents Company monopoly, and presided over the first meeting of the International Filmmakers Congress in Paris. \u00a0Further financial hardships created by his opposition to Edison and diminishing influence, M\u00e9li\u00e8s disappeared from public life. By the mid-1920s he made a meager living as a candy and toy salesma in Paris, with the assistance of funds collected by other filmmakers. \u00a0Although he was recognized for his contributions in cinema,\u00a0M\u00e9li\u00e8s spent most of his later years in poverty before being accepted into\u00a0La Maison du Retraite du Cin\u00e9ma, the film industry's retirement home in Orly. \u00a0",

Known for their sparse style, dramatic rocky locations near Lone Pine, California, and recurring stories of a lone man seeking vengeance amidst a brutal and abstract landscape, the films have, decades after their release, come to be known as some of the most important Westerns ever made,[citation needed] often compared to the works of existential writers or to narratives from the Old Testament. Until 2008, only Seven Men From Now had received a special edition DVD release, and the remainder of Boetticher's most acclaimed films, including Ride Lonesome, The Tall T, Comanche Station, Decision at Sundown, and Buchanan Rides Alone, which were once unavailable, had a DVD release on November 4, 2008 as the Budd Boetticher Box Set.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article \u00a0Budd Boetticher, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He is related to many Australian performers, being the brother of Virginia Duigan (wife of director Bruce Beresford) and uncle of Trilby Beresford.\n\nDuigan has directed 23 films, including Romero, Lawn Dogs, The Parole Officer, Sirens, and Head in the Clouds. He intended his magnum opus to be The Danny Embling Trilogy, three films centered around the character Danny Embling, an artistic youth growing up in 1960s Australia whose life is influenced by the socially changing world around him and a series of doomed love affairs. The first two films in the series were the critically acclaimed The Year My Voice Broke, and Flirting, both of which won the Australian Film Institute awards for best picture the years they were released.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article John Duigan, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

The famed Japanese film critic Nagaharu Yodogawa once dubbed him \"the true successor\" to influential filmmaker Akira Kurosawa. With the exception of his works as a film director, he is known almost exclusively by the name Beat Takeshi. Since April 2005, he has been a professor at the Graduate School of Visual Arts, Tokyo University of the Arts. Kitano owns his own talent agency and production company, Office Kitano, which launched Tokyo Filmex in 2000. Some of Kitano's earlier films are dramas about Yakuza gangsters or the police. Described by critics as using an acting style that is highly deadpan or a camera style that approaches near-stasis, Kitano often uses long takes where nothing appears to be happening, or editing that cuts immediately to the aftermath of an event. Many of his films express a bleak or nihilistic philosophy, but they are also filled with a great deal of humor and affection for their characters. Kitano's films leave paradoxical impressions and can seem controversial. While formally disguised as dark comedies or gangster movies, his films raise moral questions and provide food for thought. The Japanese public knows him primarily as a TV host and comedian, and he is well remembered for the leading role of the comedy show Oretachi Hy\u014dkin-zoku (1981\u20131989) and for the game show Takeshi's Castle (1986\u20131989). His portrayal of Zat\u014dichi in the 2003 movie is his biggest domestic commercial success. He hosts a weekly television program called Beat Takeshi's TV Tackle, a kind of panel discussion among entertainers and politicians regarding controversial current events. In 2010 the Fondation Cartier pour l'art contemporain in Paris held a one-man show displaying his paintings and installations. A room in the basement played a 12-hour loop of his work as a TV host.",

His father introduced him to martial arts when he saw his son was physically weak. At the age of 12, Van Damme began his martial arts training at Centre National De Karate (National Center of Karate) under the guidance of Master Claude Goetz in Ixelles, Belgium. Van Damme trained for 4 years and earned a spot on the Belgium Karate Team. He won the European professional karate association's middleweight championship as a teenager, and also beat the 2nd best karate fighter in the world. His goal was to be number one but got sidetracked when he left his hometown of Brussels. In 1976 at the age of sixteen, Jean-Claude started his Martial Arts fight career. \n\nJean-Claude retired from martial arts in 1982, following a knockout over Nedjad Gharbi in Brussels,Belgium. Jean-Claude posted a 18-1 (18 knockouts) Kickboxing record, and a Semi-Contact record of 41-4. He came to Hong Kong at the age of 19 for the first time and felt insured to do action movies in Hong Kong.\n\nIn 1981 Van Damme moved to Los Angeles. He took English classes while working as carpet layer, pizza delivery man, limo driver, and thanks to Chuck Norris he got a job as a bouncer at a club. Norris gave Van Damme a small role in the movie Missing in Action (1984), but it wasn't good enough to get anybody's attention. In 1984 he got his first significant role as a villain named Ivan in the low-budget movie, No Retreat, No Surrender (1986).\n\nThen one day, while walking on the streets, Jean-Claude spotted a producer for Cannon Pictures and showed some of his martial arts abilities which led to a role in Bloodsport (1988). The movie, filmed in Hong Kong, was so bad when it was completed, it was shelved for almost two years. It might have never been released if Van Damme did not help them to re-cut the film and begged producers to release it. They finally released the film, first in Malaysia and France and then into the U.S. Shot on a meager 1.5 million dollar budget, it became a U.S box-office hit in the spring of 1988. It made about 30 million worldwide and audiences supported this film for its new sensational action star, Jean-Claude Van Damme.\n\nHis good looks led to starring roles in higher budgeted movies like Cyborg (1989), A.W.O.L.: Absent Without Leave (1990), Double Impact (1991) and Universal Soldier (1992). In 1994, he scored with his big breakthrough $100 million worldwide hit Timecop (1994). But in the meantime, his personal life was coming apart. A divorce, followed by a new marriage, followed by another divorce. It began to show up in his career when his projects began to tank at the box office - The Quest (1996), which he directed; Maximum Risk (1996) and Double Team (1997). The three films made less than $50 million combined.\n\nIn 1999 he remarried his ex-wife, Gladys Portugues, and restarted his lost career to attain new goals. With help from his family, he faced his problems and made movies like Replicant (2001), Derailed (2002), and In Hell (2003).",

He appeared in the wake of the French New Wave alongside contemporaries like Jean-Luc Godard and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut. Demy's films are well known for their sumptuous look, drawing on Hollywood musicals, fairy tales, jazz, and opera. His films are also distinguishable by their overlapping continuity (i.e., characters cross over from film to film), lush musical scores (typically composed by Michel Legrand) and themes like teenage love, labor rights, incest, and the intersection between dreams and reality.",

His first major role was as Leopold Bloom in the 1968 film The Producers. This was the first in a series of prolific collaborations with writer/director Mel Brooks, including 1974's Young Frankenstein, the script of which garnered the pair an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. Wilder is known for his portrayal of Willy Wonka in Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory (1971) and for his four films with Richard Pryor: Silver Streak (1976), Stir Crazy (1980), See No Evil, Hear No Evil (1989), and Another You (1991). Wilder has directed and written several of his films, including The Woman in Red (1984).\n\nHis marriage to actress Gilda Radner, who died from ovarian cancer, led to his active involvement in promoting cancer awareness and treatment, helping found the Gilda Radner Ovarian Cancer Detection Center in Los Angeles and co-founding Gilda's Club.\n\nIn more recent years, Wilder turned his attention to writing, producing a memoir in 2005, Kiss Me Like A Stranger: My Search for Love and Art, and the novels My French Whore (2007), The Woman Who Wouldn't (2008), and What Is This Thing Called Love (2010).\n\nWilder sadly passed away on the 29th of August, 2016.\u00a0",

The two minute piece showcases the dog meandering around various places until he ends up back in his master's arms. It was shown in theaters around the United States in 2002 as an attachment to Sandler's animated film \"Eight Crazy Nights\".\n\nGoossen helped create Sandler's official website and directed several short films for the site.\n\nGoossen is currently filming his next project, \"The Shortcut\" in Saskatchewan, Canada.

Reception of the film was largely positive and received a respectable box office. Outside his central work, Morris tends to stay out of the public eye and has become one of the more enigmatic figures in British comedy.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Chris Morris (satirist), licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia. \u200b",

Marshall (December 29, 1891 \u2013 February 17, 1975) was a prolific American actor, screenwriter, producer, film and television director, active through the first six decades of movie history.\n\nRelatively few of Marshall's films are well-known today, with Destry Rides Again, The Sheepman, and How the West Was Won being the biggest exceptions. Marshall co-directed How the West Was Won with John Ford and Henry Hathaway, handling the railroad segment, which featured a celebrated buffalo stampede sequence. While Marshall worked on almost all kinds of films imaginable, he started his career in the early silent period doing mostly Westerns, a genre he never completely abandoned. Later in his career, he was particularly sought after for comedies. He did around half a dozen films each with Bob Hope and Jerry Lewis, and also worked with W.C. Fields, Jackie Gleason, Will Rogers and Laurel and Hardy.\n\nFor his contribution to the film industry, George Marshall has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7048 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article George\u00a0 Marshall, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

The Lawnmower Man is considered the first, seminal film to feature \"Virtual Reality\" as a cautionary tale becoming the number one commercially successful independent film of 1992, budgeted at just under $6 million and eventually earning over $150 million worldwide.\n\nVirtuosity became the first major film to feature nanotechnology set in a cyberpunk based future with Brett Leonard casting Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington together a full 12 years before they would again co-star and many Oscar nominations later in a 2007 project.\n\nHis work with the IMAX 3D process set him apart from most directors having gained early experience with this cutting-edge presentation medium directing T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous in IMAX 3D. The film became the first number one hit 3D movie to gross over $100 million worldwide (on IMAX screens alone).\n\nHe created a sensation when he took his \u201cSwarm Cam-Fusion Station\u201d onto The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and guest Billy Idol, and implemented one of the first live web-casts ever, from the House of Blues, LA.\n\nCreative Artists Agency and Intel Corporation hired him to direct a state-of-the-art \"interactive show\" for the CAA/Intel Media Lab to introduce the Hollywood community to the \"future of entertainment\" digitizing actor Danny DeVito, and using live performance animation to create the interactive animated character \"Mr. Head\", who guided the audience/participants through the experience.\n\nIn the music video genre Brett directed Peter Gabriel's: Kiss That Frog, the first all computer graphic (CGI) music video / motion simulator ride film to tour the world becoming the wildly popular themed entertainment attraction to win him a 1994 MTV Music Video Award.

Aged 23, he began working at the Government-owned National Film Unit, joining a group of emerging filmmakers who were investigating new subjects and styles.\n\nPillsbury directed seven films at the National Film Unit, including a multi-faceted study of artist Ralph Hotere, and a satirical look at workplace relations (Men and Supermen). He was also part of the directing team on Commonwealth Games chronicle Games 74, and worked both on set and at the editing bench for Paul Maunder's Gone Up North for a While.\n\nPillsbury went solo in 1975. Documentary Birth with R.D.Laing won awards on both sides of the Tasman, and controversy in England and the United States. The film featured controversial Scottish psychiatrist R.D. Laing critiqueing Western medical handling of childbirth. Pillsbury also worked on four documentaries for TV slot Seven Days, which variously looked into life for a solo mother, an ex-convict, hospital patients, and young M\u0101ori in the city.\n\nMore TV docos followed, then in 1978, Against the Lights, a short drama based on a Witi Ihimaera tale. Pillsbury's Round the Bays doco The Greatest Run on Earth won awards at festivals in Chicago and Torino.\n\nPillsbury's feature film debut in 1981 was with The Scarecrow, based on the gothic novel by Ronald Hugh Morrieson. Presented through the eyes of two teenage boys, the film chronicles the arrival in a 50s town of a mysterious stranger (played by American movie legend John Carradine). In 1982 The Scarecrow became the first Kiwi film to win invitation to the prestigious Cannes Film Festival, in the non-competitive Director's Fortnight section. Teen star Jono Smith later reinvented himself as a cinematographer in England.\n\nPillsbury then worked extensively on a screen adaptation of end of the world sci-fi novel The Quiet Earth, before handing the project to director Geoff Murphy after deciding it needed fresh eyes (he later joked at being one of the only directors who had fired himself). Instead Pillsbury helmed 1880s immigrant tale Heart of the High Country for TV (based on a novel by Elizabeth Gowans), then segued into period road movie Starlight Hotel, which starred Smash Palace discovery Greer Robson.\n\nSince Starlight Hotel, Pillsbury has directed extensively, mainly on American tele-movies. He returned to Kiwi moviemaking in 2000 for Crooked Earth, the tale of a clash between two M\u0101ori: a militant drug-dealer, and former military man Temuera Morrison.\n\nPillsbury's other features include Free Willy 3: The Rescue, 2008 road movie Endless Bummer and Knight Rider 2010.\n\nThese days Pillsbury has a second career as a winemaker. In 2000 he and a business partner sold Arizona wine company Dos Cabezas to a group headed by the lead singer for rock group Tool (band). Pillsbury Wine Company was launched soon afterwards.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Sam Pillsbury, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.  Robert Rossen (March 16, 1908 \u2013 February 18, 1966) was an American screenwriter, film director, and producer whose film career spanned almost three decades. His 1949 film All the King's Men won Oscars for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress, while Rossen was nominated for an Oscar as Best Director. He won the Golden Globe for Best Director and the film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Picture. In 1961 he made The Hustler, which was nominated for nine Oscars and won two. Rossen was nominated as Best Director and with Sidney Carroll for Best Adapted Screenplay but did not win either award.\n\nAfter directing and writing for the stage in New York, Rossen moved to Hollywood in 1937. There he worked as a screenwriter for Warner Bros. until 1941, and then interrupted his career to serve until 1944 as the chairman of the Hollywood Writers Mobilization Against the War, a body to organize writers for the effort in World War II. In 1945 he joined a picket line against Warner Bros., making an enemy of Jack Warner. After making one film for Hal Wallis's new-formed production company, Rossen made one for Columbia Pictures, another for Wallis and most of his later films for his own companies, usually in collaboration with Columbia.\n\nRossen was a member of the American Communist Party from 1937 to about 1947, and believed the Party was \"dedicated to social causes of the sort that we as poor Jews from New York were interested in.\"[1] However, he finally ended all relations with the Party in 1949. Rossen was twice called before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), in 1951 and in 1953. He exercised his Fifth Amendment rights at his first appearance, refusing to state whether he had ever been a Communist. As a result he was unofficially blacklisted by the Hollywood studio bosses, and he was unable to renew his passport. At his second appearance he named 57 people as current or former Communists and was removed from the unofficial blacklist.\n\nAfter this, he had to produce his next film, Mambo, in Italy in 1954 to repair his finances. While The Hustler in 1961 was a great success, conflict with the star of Lilith so disillusioned Rossen that he made no more films during the last three years of his life.\n\nRossen's films for Warner generally described the conditions of working people, the portrayal of gangsters and racketeers, and opposition to fascism. He wrote that ambition and the desire for success were common themes in his work. His films often featured strong female characters. All Rossen's playscripts were adaptions except three which were based on real events. While head of production at Warner, Wallis considered that some of his best films were written by Rossen.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Robert Rossen, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Hellman's most critically acclaimed film to date has been Two-Lane Blacktop (1971), a road movie that was a box office failure at the time of its initial release but has subsequently turned into a perennial cult favorite. Hellman's two acid westerns starring Jack Nicholson, Ride in the Whirlwind and The Shooting, both shot in 1965 and released directly to television in 1968, have also developed cult followings, particularly the latter. A third western, China 9, Liberty 37 (1978), was far less successful critically, although it too has its admirers, as do Cockfighter (1974) (aka Born to Kill) \u00a0and Iguana (1988). In 1989 he directed the straight-to-video slasher film Silent Night, Deadly Night 3: Better Watch Out!. In 2006, he directed \"Stanley's Girlfriend,\" a section of the omnibus horror film Trapped Ashes. Hellman's section of the film was presented by the Cannes Film Festival that year as an \"Official Selection\" and Hellman was named president of the Festival's \"Un Certain Regard\" jury. In 2009, he began production on a new feature film, the romantic film noir thriller, Road to Nowhere, which is scheduled to compete for the Golden Lion at the 67th Venice International Film Festival. He currently teaches in the Film Directing Program at the California Institute of the Arts. At the 2010 Venice Film Festival he was awarded with a Special Lion Award for Overall Work.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Monte Hellman, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nRobert Kenner is an American film and television screenwriter, television director, film director, film producer, and television producer.\n\nHis career began in 1971 as an assistant cinematographer, and produced his first motion picture, 3:15 - The Moment of Truth, in 1984 (although it was not released until 1986). His second feature film did not come until 1991's Lonely Hearts.\n\nHis first breakout project was the televised documentary The Lost Fleet of Guadalcanal, which he produced for the National Geographic Society and which aired in 1993 on PBS. The following year, he directed and produced Russia's Last Tsar for National Geographic and PBS. He also directed and produced America's Endangered Species: Don't Say Good-bye in 1996. The International Documentary Association presented the picture with the Strand Award for Best Documentary.\n\nKenner began a long association with the award-winning PBS documentary television program American Experience in 1998. That year he directed and produced the widely reviewed Influenza, 1918 (about the 1918 flu pandemic)and followed it up with John Brown's Holy War (about abolitionist John Brown) in 2001. His first documentary which he wrote, directed and produced was War Letters, which aired on American Experience in 2001. The documentary is based on the 2001 New York Times best-selling book War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars by historian Andrew Carroll. He produced the episode, \"The Road to Memphis,\" for the 2003 PBS documentary series, The Blues, and in 2005 produced and directed the Vietnam War documentary, Two Days in October. The documentary was the season premiere of American Experience. The film, which is based on David Maraniss' book They Marched into Sunlight, looks at the parallels between a Viet Cong ambush of a U.S. Army patrol (and the subsequent cover-up of the loss by the American military) and a violent clash between police and student protesters at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison\u2014events which occurred 24 hours apart in October 1967. The episode was nominated for and won the award for Exceptional Merit in Nonfiction Filmmaking at the 2006 Emmy Awards.\n\nIn 2008, Kenner produced and directed the documentary film, Food, Inc., which examines large-scale agricultural food production in the United States, concluding that the meat and vegetables produced by this type of economic enterprise leads to inexpensive but environmentally harmful and unhealthy food.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Robert Kenner, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.\u200b",

His photographs were used to illustrate Charles Gaines' 1974 essay \"Pumping Iron\", on which Butler later based his first documentary feature, Pumping Iron (1977). The film showcased Schwarzenegger and other bodybuilders that is credited with starting Schwarzenegger's film career. Butler later directed a sequel, also based on Gaines' writing, called Pumping Iron II: The Women (1985). It featured Bev Francis, Rachel McLish, and several other women.\n\nButler initially worked sparingly as a documentary filmmaker making 3 films between 1977 and 1999. However, in recent years he has started to work more regularly. In 2000, he made The Endurance a 97 minute documentary about Ernest Shackleton's failed Antarctic expedition in 1914. The film was well received by critics, and was nominated for and won several awards.The following year, Butler released a documentary, Shackleton's Antarctic Adventure, which recounts the crew's heroism. Narrated by Kevin Spacey, the film is 57 minutes shorter than The Endurance.\n\nIn 2004, Butler again collaborated with John Kerry this time to make the documentary Going Upriver. Going Upriver is about Kerry's Vietnam experiences, his activity in the peace movement following his return from Vietnam, and his current political views and theories. It includes footage from the early 1970s of Kerry along with current interviews of Kerry and a host of other veterans.\n\nButler's most recent documentary is Roving Mars (2006), a 40 min. documentary about the twin Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, which were launched by NASA in 2004.\n\nOn December 31, 2008, Butler's close friend Charlie Rose included a segment on Butler in his annual New Year's Eve tribute to recently deceased notables on PBS. However, Butler was not deceased; another notable George Butler, a record producer, was the one who had died\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article George Butler, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nMarcel Carn\u00e9 (August 18, 1906 \u2013 October 31, 1996) was a French film director.\n\nBorn in Paris, France, the son of a cabinet maker whose wife died when their son was five, Carn\u00e9 began his career as a film critic, becoming editor of the weekly publication, Hebdo-Films, and working for Cin\u00e9magazine and Cin\u00e9monde between 1929 and 1933. In the same period he worked in silent film as a camera assistant with director Jacques Feyder. By age 25, Carn\u00e9 had already directed his first short film, Nogent, Eldorado du dimanche (1929). He assisted Feyder (and Ren\u00e9 Clair) on several films through to La kermesse h\u00e9ro\u00efque (1935).\n\nFeyder accepted an invitation to work in England for Alexander Korda, for whom he made Knight Without Armour (1937), but made it possible for Carn\u00e9 to take over his project, Jenny (1936), as its director.[4] The film marked the beginning of a successful collaboration with surrealist poet and screenwriter Jacques Pr\u00e9vert. This collaborative relationship lasted for more than a dozen years, during which Carn\u00e9 and Pr\u00e9vert created their best remembered films. Together, they were involved in the poetic realism film movement of fatalistic tragedies.\n\nUnder the German occupation of France during World War II, Carn\u00e9 worked in the Vichy zone where he subverted the regime's attempts to control art; several of his team were Jewish, including Joseph Kosma and set designer Alexandre Trauner. Under difficult conditions they made Carn\u00e9's most highly regarded film Les Enfants du paradis (Children of Paradise, 1945) released after the Liberation of France. In the late 1990s, the film was voted \"Best French Film of the Century\" in a poll of 600 French critics and professionals. Post war, he and Pr\u00e9vert followed this triumph with what at the time was the most expensive production ever undertaken in the history of French film. But the result, titled Les Portes de la nuit, was panned by the critics and a box office failure and was their last completed film.\n\nBy the 1950s, Carn\u00e9's reputation was in eclipse. The critics of Cahiers du Cinema, who became the film makers of the New Wave, dismissed him and placed his film's merits solely with Prevert. Other than his 1958 hit Les Tricheurs, Carn\u00e9's postwar films met with only uneven success and many were greeted by an almost unrelenting negative criticism from the press and within members of the film industry. In 1958, Carn\u00e9 was the Head of the Jury at the 6th Berlin International Film Festival. Carn\u00e9 made his last film in 1976.\n\nCarn\u00e9 was gay and made little secret about it. Several of his later films contain references to male homosexuality or bisexuality. His one-time partner was Roland Lesaffre who appeared in many of his films.\n\nIn 1989 a book was published by Edward Baron Turk as part of the Harvard Film Studies that told his story under the title Child of Paradise: Marcel Carn\u00e9 and the Golden Age of French Cinema.\n\nMarcel Carn\u00e9 died in 1996 in Clamart, Hauts-de-Seine, and was buried in the Cimeti\u00e8re Saint-Vincent in Montmartre.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Marcel Carn\u00e9, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "Edward Dmytryk (September 4, 1908 \u2013 July 1, 1999) was an American film director who was amongst the Hollywood Ten, a group of blacklisted film industry professionals who served time in prison for being in contempt of Congress during the McCarthy-era 'red scare'.\n\nAlthough born in Grand Forks, British Columbia, Canada, Dmytryk grew up in San Francisco when his Ukrainian parents moved to the United States. At the age of 31, he became a naturalized citizen.\n\nHis best known films from the pre-McCarthy period of his career were film noirs Crossfire, for which he received a Best Director Oscar nomination, and Murder, My Sweet, the latter an adaptation of Raymond Chandler's Farewell My Lovely. In addition, he made two World War II films: Hitler's Children, the story of the Hitler youth and Back to Bataan starring John Wayne.\n\nThe late 1940's was the time of the Second Red Scare, and Dmytryk was one of many filmmakers investigated. Summoned to appear before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC), he refused to cooperate and was sent to jail. After spending several months behind bars, Dmytryk made the decision to testify again, and give the names of his fellow members in the American Communist Party as the HUAC had demanded. On April 25, 1951, Dmytryk appeared before HUAC for the second time, answering all questions. He spoke of his own Party past, a very brief membership in 1945, including the naming of twenty-six former members of left-wing groups. He explained how John Howard Lawson, Adrian Scott, Albert Maltz and others had pressured him to include communist propaganda in his films. His testimony damaged several court cases that others of the so-called \"Hollywood 10\" had filed. He recounted his experiences of the period in his revealing 1996 book, Odd Man Out: A Memoir of the Hollywood Ten (Southern Illinois University Press, Carbondale, IL).\n\nFor a time, Dmytryk moved to England, and Stanley Kramer hired him to direct a trio of low-budget films before handing Dmytryk The Caine Mutiny. He made films for major studios Columbia, 20th Century Fox, MGM and Paramount Pictures, including, among others, Raintree County, The Left Hand of God, The Young Lions, a remake of the Marlene Dietrich classic The Blue Angel, and The Carpetbaggers. Later into the 60' and 70's, he directed Where Love Has Gone, Anzio, Alvarez Kelly, Shalako, and his final film Bluebeard. The films which he directed featured stars such as Humphrey Bogart, Clark Gable, Gene Tierney, Spencer Tracy, Elizabeth Taylor, Bette Davis, Montgomery Clift, Marlon Brando, Sean Connery, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, Richard Widmark and Henry Fonda.\n\nAfter his film career tapered off in the 1970s, he entered academia and taught at the University of Texas at Austin, and at the University of Southern California. He wrote several books on the art of filmmaking (such as \"On Film Editing\") and lectured at various colleges and theaters, such as the Orson Welles Cinema. Dmytryk died from heart and kidney failure on 1 July, 1999, aged 90, in Encino, California.",

He intended to become a doctor, but became interested in journalism and edited Granta, the Cambridge University magazine.\n\nAfter travelling in Turkey, Israel and Syria, Brian started at the BBC as a research assistant for Rene Cutforth's program, \"Europa.\" He then produced several excellent editions of Horizon, a science TV magazine. Gibson received a BAFTA award and the 1975 Prix Italia for the \"Horizon\" episode Joey, based on \"Tongue tied\" the story of a brain-damaged child, by Joey Deacon who, in his adult life, found a handicapped friend to unlock his latent intellect.\n\nAfter this he made The Billion Dollar Bubble, which introduced James Woods to British audiences, and Gossip from the Forest with John Shrapnel. He went on to direct Dennis Potter's Blue Remembered Hills with, among others, Colin Welland, Helen Mirren and John Bird, as well as Breaking Glass with Hazel O'Connor, Phil Daniels and Jonathan Pryce.\n\nIn Hollywood, he directed Poltergeist II and HBO specials which included biographies of Simon Wiesenthal and Josephine Baker.

In 1998 he directed his last film, Still Crazy.\n\nGibson married the leading lady of his TV film \"The Josephine Baker Story\" Lynn Whitfield. They had a daughter named Grace Gibson and divorced in 1992. He remarried Paula Rae Gibson and had another daughter before he died of Ewing's sarcoma, a form of cancer, at his London home in 2004.

A character from this series, Alan Partridge, went on to feature in a number of Iannucci's television and radio programmes including Knowing Me, Knowing You and I'm Alan Partridge. In the meantime, Iannucci also fronted the satirical Armistice review shows and in 2001 created his most personal work, The Armando Iannucci Shows for Channel 4.\n\nMoving back to the BBC in 2005, Iannucci created the political sitcom The Thick of It as well as the spoof documentary Time Trumpet in 2006. Winning funding from the UK Film Council, he directed a critically acclaimed feature film In the Loop featuring characters from The Thick of It in 2009. As a result of these works, he has been being described by The Daily Telegraph as \"the hardman of political satire\".[2] Other works during this period include a operetta libretto, Skin Deep and his radio series Charm Offensive.

Hung is one of the pivotal figures who spearheaded the Hong Kong New Wave movement of the 1980s, helped reinvent the martial arts genre and started the vampire-like Jiang Shi genre. He is widely credited with assisting many of his compatriots, giving them their starts in the Hong Kong film industry, by casting them in the films he produced, or giving them roles in the production crew. In East Asia, it is common for people to address their elders or influential people with familial nouns as a sign of familiarity and respect. Jackie Chan, for example, is often addressed as \"Dai Goh\", meaning Big Brother. Hung was also known as \"Dai Goh\", until the filming of Project A, which featured both actors. As Hung was the eldest of the kung fu \"brothers\", and the first to make a mark on the industry, he was given the nickname \"Dai Goh Dai\", meaning, Big, Big Brother or Biggest Big Brother.

His feature films include Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives, winner of the prestigious 2010 Cannes Film Festival Palme d'Or prize; Tropical Malady, which won a jury prize at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival; Blissfully Yours, which won the top prize in the Un Certain Regard program at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival; and Syndromes and a Century, which premiered at the 63rd Venice Film Festival and was the first Thai film to be entered in competition there. Working outside the strict confines of the Thai film studio system, Weerasethakul has directed several features and dozens of short films. Themes reflected in his films (frequently discussed in interviews) include dreams, nature, sexuality (including his own homosexuality), and Western perceptions of Thailand and Asia, and his films display a preference for unconventional narrative structures (like placing titles/credits at the middle of a film) and for working with non-actors. Cinephiles affectionately refer to him as \"Joe\" (a nickname that he, like many with similarly long Thai names, has adopted out of convenience).\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article\u00a0Apichatpong \u00a0Weerasethakul, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He has worked on such shows as The Outer Limits, Stargate SG-1 (including its two-hour pilot), and Stargate Atlantis. In 2008 he directed all eight episodes of the highly acclaimed and award winning HBO Canada/TMN miniseries ZOS: Zone of Separation, which he co created and produced. Mario Philip Azzopardi should not be confused with Maltese poet, short story writer and columnist Mario Azzopardi (born 1944), who is also involved in theatre and directs the Malta Drama Centre. In 1971, while still a student at the Royal University of Malta, he directed Ga\u0121\u0121a, presumed to be the first full-length feature filmed entirely in Maltese. Transferred to digital format and enhanced, the film was re-released in Malta in March 2007. Azzopardi left his native Malta for Canada in 1978, following a dispute with local censors and theatre authorities who, in 1977, had cancelled his play, Sulari Fuq Strada Stretta, on the grounds that it was too offensive; the play was eventually presented at the Manoel Theatre in January 2008. Azzopardi was educated at St Aloysius' College (Birkirkara, Malta), and the Royal University of Malta. Azzopardi is married to Therese and has three children, Lara Azzopardi, Kyra Azzopardi and Yari Azzopardi.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article\u00a0Mario Azzopardi,\u00a0\u00a0licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He not only directs his productions, he is usually also writer, editor, composer and cinematographer.\n\nDupieux's second feature film Steak was released in France on 20 June 2007.\n\nFilming for the absurdist thriller Rubber began in 2009. The electronic music duo Justice stated that they would be working on the soundtrack for Rubber, saying they had to 'finish working on the soundtrack for Mr. Oizo's new film before we start recording for the new album'. However, only Gaspard Aug\u00e9 of the duo collaborated with Dupieux on the soundtrack. The film had a United States Video on Demand release.\n\nThe surreal comedy Wrong premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2012.\n\nThe comedy Wrong Cops was produced by Realitism Films, who describe it as \"a filthy 90 minute comedy about some disturbed cops.

He is married to filmmaker, photographer, and actress Ebru Ceylan, with whom he co-starred in Climates (2006).\n\nCeylan's films deal with the estrangement of the individual, existentialism, the monotony of human lives, and the details of everyday life. He uses static shots and long takes, usually in natural settings, as well as play with sound, including the use of menacing silences. He is known for filming his protagonist from behind, which, in his view, leaves the audiences to speculate on the brooding emotions of characters whose faces are obscured.

After a few more assistant or second director jobs, McLaglen directed his first film Gun The Man Down in 1956 - a western B-movie with James Arness, Angie Dickinson and Harry Carey, Jr.. He went on to work extensively in television directing, directing episodes of Perry Mason (7), Gunslinger (5), Rawhide (6), and then 99 episodes of Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel, The Lieutenant (4), The Virginian (2), and 96 episodes of Gunsmoke.

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nJean Negulesco (born Jean Negulescu; 26 February 1900 \u2013 18 July 1993) was a Romanian-born American film director and screenwriter.\n\nBorn in Craiova, he attended Carol I High School. In 1915 he moved to Vienna, in 1919 to Bucharest, where he worked as a painter, before becoming a stage decorator in Paris. In 1927 he went to New York City for an exhibition of his paintings, and settled there.\n\nIn 1934 he entered the film industry, first as a sketch artist, then as an assistant producer, second unit director and in the late 1930s he became a director and screenwriter. He made a reputation at Warner Brothers by directing short subjects, particularly a series of band shorts featuring unusual camera angles and dramatic use of shadows and silhouettes.\n\nNegulesco's first feature film as director was Singapore Woman (1941). In 1948 he was nominated for an Academy Award for Directing for Johnny Belinda. In 1955, he won the BAFTA Award for Best Film for How to Marry a Millionaire. His 1959 movie, The Best of Everything, was on Entertainment Weekly's \"Top 50 Cult Films of All-Time\" list.\n\nFrom the late 1960s, he lived in Marbella, Spain where he died there at age 93, of heart failure.\n\nDuring his Hollywood career and in his 1984 autobiography, Negulesco claimed to have been born on 29 February 1900; he was apparently motivated to make this statement because birthdays on Leap Year Day are comparatively rare. In fact, 1900 was not a leap year, so there was no 29 February in 1900. Negulesco's autobiography (in which this claim appears) is appropriately titled Things I Did and Things I Think I Did.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Jean Negulesco, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia\u200b",

After World War II service in the 1st Cavalry Division, Muskegon, Michigan-born Kennedy found work writing for radio, then used his training as a cavalry officer to secure a job as a fencing trainer and fencing stunt doubles in films. That led to Kennedy being hired to write for a television program with a fencing theme for John Wayne's Batjac productions. Although the TV program was never produced it led the young writer to write screenplays for a number of Batjac films starting with the 1956 film Seven Men from Now. In the 1960s, after also becoming a film director, Kennedy moved on to write for western television programs.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Burt Kennedy, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Billed as Michael Wadley, he gained notice for his work from critics who followed independent and underground films, but the films, primarily aimed at a specialized and counterculture audience, brought him no financial success.\n\nIn April-May 1969, Wadleigh undertook the monumental task of documenting the rock music festival scheduled in the vicinity of Woodstock, New York on August 15-18. He arrived on the site in Bethel with over a thousand reels of film and a crew of several camera operators. The finished product was said to have consisted of about 120 miles of footage which, over the next months, was edited down to 184 minutes. Warner Brothers, the film's primary financial backer, released it on March 26, 1970.\n\nThe film, which reportedly cost $600,000 to produce, earned over $50 million in the United States and more millions from foreign rentals, but due to a complicated arrangement with Warner Brothers, Wadleigh received only a small percentage of the profits. Woodstock stands as a milestone in the documentary film field, receiving an Academy Award for Documentary Feature at the 1971 ceremony.\n\nJanis, a 1974 documentary about Janis Joplin, gave Wadleigh credit as cinematographer for his archive footage, but it would be eleven years after the release of Woodstock before he received his next and, last to date, directorial credit. Wolfen, a unique 1981 horror phantasmagoria based on the novel by Whitley Strieber, was praised for its dreamlike nature and striking visual quality, but despite a top-notch star turn from Albert Finney, turned out to have been too offbeat for the general public to achieve financial success. Wadleigh also wrote the Wolfen screenplay and has a bit part as \"Terrorist Informer.\"\n\nIn August 1994, twenty-four years after its original showing, a 228-minute \"director's cut\" of Woodstock was released, and in 1999, another Woodstock-based documentary, Jimi Hendrix: Live at Woodstock gave Wadleigh another archive footage credit for cinematography.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Michael Wadleigh, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

In 1924, he directed Lon Chaney in the first cut of The Phantom of the Opera, which was largely revisited at the request of the production. He soon fell into a professional decline after the advent of sound, and after directing The Cat Creeps and Love Comes Along (both in 1930), his career faded.\n\nRupert Julian died in Hollywood, California at the age of 64 and was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Rupert Julian, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He is known for his pioneering work in television and film and for his controversial style. He has been criticized as being over-obsessed with sexuality and the church. His subject matter is often about famous composers, or based on other works of art which he adapts loosely. Russell began directing for the BBC, where he did creative adaptations of composers' lives which were unusual for the time. He also directed many feature films independently and for studios.\n\nHe is best known for his Oscar-winning film Women in Love (1969), The Devils (1971), The Who's Tommy (1975), and the science fiction film Altered States (1980).\n\nOne noted admirer, the British film critic Mark Kermode, attempting to sum up the director's achievement, called Russell; \"somebody who proved that British cinema didn't have to be about kitchen-sink realism - it could be every bit as flamboyant as Fellini. He now makes very strange experimental films like Lion's Mouth and Revenge of the Elephant Man, and they are as edgy and out there as the work he made in the 1970s.\"\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Ken Russell, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

In 2006 he directed, co-wrote, co-produced, and co-starred in his first film The Foot Fist Way, which he based on his experience as a Taekwondo black belt and instructor. His follow-up film, Observe and Report, stars Seth Rogen and was released on April 10, 2009. Hill is also co-creator and executive producer of the HBO series Eastbound &amp; Down.\n\nThe Foot Fist Way was seen by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay who bought the distributing rights to the film. This led to a cult following. He was invited to the set of Knocked Up where he met future collaborator, Seth Rogen. Hill was asked to do a cameo appearance with writing partner Ben Best in Rogen's next film, Superbad as Tut Long John Silver. Hill later cast Rogen as the leading man in his film, Observe and Report which opened at number 4 at the box office. The role of Ronnie was written specifically for Rogen. Hill is married to Collette Wolfe, who is an actress also seen in his movies Observe and Report and The Foot Fist Way.\n\nIn 2010, Hill directed the parody music video Swagger Wagon as part of ad agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's campaign for the Sienna SE minivan from Toyota.\n\nHill's next film L.A.P.I. was announced as an action comedy about a hardboiled private investigator, played by friend and frequent collaborator Danny McBride. It is the first film Hill has directed but not written. The script was written by Michael Diliberti and Matthew Sullivan, who have written two scripts on the 2009 Black List: Comi-Con and a remake of Brewster's Millions. It is also the first film produced by Hill's, McBride's, and friend David Gordon Green's new production company, Rough House Pictures.

In a professional career that lasted less than fifteen years, he completed forty feature length films; two television film series; three short films; four video productions; twenty-four stage plays and four radio plays; and thirty-six acting roles in his own and others\u2019 films. He also worked as an actor (film and theater), author, cameraman, composer, designer, editor, producer and theater manager.\n\nUnderlying Fassbinder's work was a desire to provoke and disturb. His phenomenal creative energy, when working, coexisted with a wild, self-destructive libertinism that earned him a reputation as the enfant terrible of the New German Cinema, as well as being its central figure. He had tortured personal relationships with the actors and technicians around him who formed a surrogate family. However, his pictures demonstrate his deep sensitivity to social outsiders and his hatred of institutionalized violence. He ruthlessly attacked both German bourgeois society and the larger limitations of humanity.\n\nFassbinder died in June 1982 at the age of 37 from a lethal cocktail of cocaine and barbiturates. His death has often been cited as the event that ended the New German Cinema movement.",

        "biography": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was the largest and most powerful studio in Hollywood when Gene Kelly arrived in town in 1941. He came direct from the hit 1940 original Broadway production of \"Pal Joey\" and planned to return to the Broadway stage after making the one film required by his contract. His first picture for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was For Me and My Gal (1942) with Judy Garland. What kept Kelly in Hollywood were \"the kindred creative spirits\" he found behind the scenes at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The talent pool was especially large during World War II, when Hollywood was a refuge for many musicians and others in the performing arts of Europe who were forced to flee the Nazis. After the war, a new generation was coming of age. Those who saw An American in Paris (1951) would try to make real life as romantic as the reel life they saw portrayed in that musical, and the first time they saw Paris, they were seeing again in memory the seventeen-minute ballet sequence set to the title song written by George Gershwin and choreographed by Kelly. The sequence cost a half million dollars (U.S.) to make in 1951 dollars. Another Kelly musical of the era, Singin' in the Rain (1952), was one of the first 25 films selected by the Library of Congress for its National Film Registry. Kelly was in the same league as Fred Astaire, but instead of a top hat and tails Kelly wore work clothes that went with his masculine, athletic dance style. Gene Kelly died at age 83 of complications from two strokes on February 2, 1996 in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, California.",

        "biography": "Giovanissimo forma il trio comico \"Fratelli d'Italia\" con gli amici Giorgio Panariello e Carlo Conti e con quest'ultimo conduce in una rete televisiva locale il variet\u00e0 Succo d'arancia. Ha collaborato con gli amici Panariello e Conti alla realizzazione del programma Vernice Fresca sul circuito televisivo nazionale Cinquestelle di cui era presidente Francesco Grandinetti. Ha debuttato nella televisione nazionale alla fine degli anni ottanta partecipando a DeeJay Television su Italia 1 col nome d'arte di Zeba (esordendo inizialmente con uno sketch comico in cui fingeva di essere un cameraman passato davanti alla telecamera, per poi acquistare sempre maggiore spazio dentro il programma).  Dopo una dura e lunga gavetta nel cabaret, fece la sua prima apparizione a teatro con lo spettacolo comico Leonardo Pieraccioni Show (1990). L'anno successivo Alessandro Benvenuti lo volle nel suo film Zitti e mosca, che fu la prima esperienza cinematografica di Leonardo; in autunno inizia la sua esperienza come concorrente al concorso per \"nuovi talenti\" all'interno di Fantastico 12 (condotto da Raffaella Carr\u00e0 e Johnny Dorelli e terminato nel gennaio successivo) in cui poi giunger\u00e0 secondo. Nella primavera del 1992 partecipa come ospite fisso al programma televisivo di taglio giovanile Europop (argomenti fissi trattati: viaggi musica e cultura varia) condotto da Elisa Jane Satta (ex vj di Videomusic) e in onda su Raidue per alcune puntate a partire dall'8 marzo 1992[1]  I successi di Villaggio vacanze Pieraccioni e Fratelli d'Italia, ottimi esempi di spettacoli comici a teatro, convinsero Pieraccioni a provare la carta di regista cinematografico: esord\u00ec nel grande schermo con I laureati, che fu campione d'incassi nel 1995: la pellicola cost\u00f2 2 miliardi di lire e ne incass\u00f2 15. Oltre allo stesso Pieraccioni, si distinse come attore Massimo Ceccherini, amico e spesso collaboratore di Leonardo. Nella colonna sonora si distingue il brano degli Audio2 Alle venti.  In seguito scrisse, diresse e interpret\u00f2 Il ciclone (in cui prest\u00f2 la voce anche il grande Mario Monicelli) nel 1996, con nel cast i suoi amici di sempre Massimo Ceccherini, Alessandro Haber. Il botteghino durante le feste impazzisce, alla fine i miliardi saranno ben 75. Nell'anno successivo sar\u00e0 la volta di Fuochi d'artificio, la trama varia ma non il modus operandi, poco importa anche qui il successo \u00e8 sbalorditivo, il miliardi di lire sono poco pi\u00f9 di 70.  Dopo due pellicole di discreto successo come Il pesce innamorato (1999) e Il principe e il pirata (2001), che per\u00f2 non riuscirono a ripetere gli eccezionali numeri dei due precedenti film, torn\u00f2 alla ribalta nel 2003 con Il paradiso all'improvviso nel quale, pur senza stravolgere completamente il suo stile, lo unisce alla spiritosaggine sgrammaticata di Anna Maria Barbera, in arte Sconsolata.  Nel 2005 ha diretto ed interpretato Ti amo in tutte le lingue del mondo, dove Giorgio Panariello interpreta suo fratello e Massimo Ceccherini un frate, e nel 2007 Una moglie bellissima, coinvolgendo ancora una volta Massimo Ceccherini e arruolando nel cast Laura Torrisi, ex concorrente del Grande Fratello alla sua prima prova d'attrice, e Gabriel Garko. Dopo pochi mesi, alcune riviste lo paparazzano assieme alla Torrisi: in poco tempo i due annunciano il loro fidanzamento e hanno avuto una figlia, Martina, nata il 13 dicembre 2010.  Successivamente il 18 dicembre 2009 esce il film Io &amp; Marilyn, come di consueto, nel periodo natalizio[2], stessa sorte per il film di Natale 2011. Il film dal titolo Ho adottato la felicit\u00e0 vede Pieraccioni nei panni di un professore ecologista di Lucca. (Wikipedia.org)",

His films are known for incorporating sexuality, and are often categorized as erotica.\n\nHe was born Zalman Lefkovitz in Trenton, New Jersey, U.S. As a young man in 1963 he played a gang member on Alfred Hitchcock Presents (\"Memo from Purgatory\" written by Harlan Ellison) with James Caan and Walter Koenig. In 1967 he played the outlaw Muley in \"Muley\", an episode of the TV show Gunsmoke. His character shoots Marshall Matt Dillon as part of a plan to rob the Dodge City Bank, but as he and his gang are waiting for Dillon to recover (so they can try again to kill him), Muley falls in love with one of the girls at the Long Branch Saloon, which thwarts the plan.\n\nFrom September 1970 until May 1971, King played attorney Aaron Silverman on the drama The Young Lawyers, broadcast on the ABC television network. King later contributed a unique delivery to Trip with the Teacher (1975), portraying the psychopathic Al, a narcoleptic murdering motorbiker.\n\nKing has directed several commercially successful films, including Two Moon Junction (1988), Wild Orchid (1990), and Red Shoe Diaries (1992), which became a long-running television series for Showtime network. It spawned many sequels. He is perhaps best known for his collaboration with director Adrian Lyne on the film 9\u00bd Weeks which starred Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke. He produced (and usually directed) the television series and film ChromiumBlue.com and Showtime series Body Language. He appeared in Lee Grant's directorial debut feature film Tell Me a Riddle.\n\nOther work as director includes the 1995 film Delta of Venus based on the book by Ana\u00efs Nin and starring Audie England. The film about an American girl living in Paris in 1939 is in many ways reminiscent of European art house films where erotica forms a centerpiece to a plot which is nevertheless about greater issues.\n\nHe is married to writer/producer Patricia Louisianna Knop. They have collaborated on many projects, such as writing Wild Orchid, Delta of Venus and 9\u00bd Weeks as well as many episodes of Red Shoe Diaries. They have two daughters, Chloe King and Gillian Lefkowitz.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Zalman King, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

His career took off in 1961 with his cult classic The Awful Dr. Orloff, which received wide distribution in the United States and England. Though he had some American box office success with Necronomicon (1967), his first women-in-prison film Ninety-Nine Women (1968) and his two Christopher Lee films, The Bloody Judge and Count Dracula, he never achieved wide commercial success. Franco moved from Spain to France in 1970 so that he could make more violent and sexual films, and it was at this point that his career began to go downhill commercially, as he turned to low-budget filmmaking with a heavier accent on adult-oriented films. Although he produced a few well-received, low budget horror films in the early 70's (Dracula vs Frankenstein, Vampyros Lesbos), many people in the industry considered him a porn director due to the huge number of X-rated adult films he began churning out. Franco returned to low-budget horror in a brief comeback period from 1980-1983 (Bloody Moon, Mondo Cannibale, Oasis of the Zombies), but after 1983, his career took a second downturn. With the exception of his Faceless (1988) and Killer Barbys (1996), his post-1984 films are almost unwatchable due to the incredibly low budgets he was forced to work with. Franco has nevertheless retained a large cult following through the years with his sexually-charged horror films, some of which are regarded as masterpieces by his avid followers. His fans tend to obsessively collect all of his films (both the good and the execrable) and line up for hours at horror conventions for a chance to meet him in person.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Jes\u00fas Franco, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia\u200b",

In 1941 he won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for the film The Great McGinty.\n\nSturges took the screwball comedy format of the 1930s to another level, writing dialogue that, heard today, is often surprisingly naturalistic, mature, and ahead of its time, despite the farcical situations.\n\nIn recent years, film scholars such as Alessandro Pirolini have also argued that Sturges' cinema anticipated more experimental narratives by contemporary directors such as Joel and Ethan Coen, Robert Zemeckis, and Woody Allen, along with prolific The Simpsons writer John Swartzwelder: \"Many of [Sturges'] movies and screenplays reveal a restless and impatient attempt to escape codified rules and narrative schemata, and to push the mechanisms and conventions of their genre to the extent of unveiling them to the spectator. [See for example] the disruption of standardized timelines in films such as The Power and the Glory and The Great McGinty [or the way] an apparently classical comedy such as Unfaithfully Yours (1948) shifts into the realm of multiple and hypothetical narratives.\n\nPrior to Sturges, other figures in Hollywood (such as Charlie Chaplin, D.W. Griffith, and Frank Capra) had directed films from their own scripts. However, Sturges is often regarded as the first Hollywood figure to be initially mainly successfully established as a screenwriter and then to subsequently move into directing his own scripts, at a time when those roles were mostly entrenched and separate. Famously, Sturges sold the story for The Great McGinty to Paramount Pictures for $1, in return for being allowed to direct the film; the sum was quietly raised to $10 by the studio for legal reasons.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Preston Sturges, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He graduated in 1950 from the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music and began working in documentary film. He directed his first feature film, Pitfall (1962), in collaboration with author K\u014db\u014d Abe and musician T\u014dru Takemitsu. The film won the NHK New Director's award, and throughout the 1960s, he continued to collaborate on films with Abe and Takemitsu while simultaneously pursuing his interest in ikebana and sculpture on a professional level.\n\nIn 1965, the Teshigahara/Abe film Woman in the Dunes (1964) was nominated for an Academy Award and won the Special Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. In 1972, he worked with Japanese researcher and translator John Nathan to make the movie Summer Soldiers, a film set during the Vietnam War about American deserters living on the fringe of Japanese society.\n\nFrom the mid-1970s onwards, he worked less frequently on feature films as he concentrated more on documentaries, exhibitions and the Sogetsu School and became grand master of the school in 1980.\n\nIn 1978, Teshigahara Hiroshi directed the final two episodes of the long running and popular Japanese television series Shin Zatouichi, starring Shintar\u014d Katsu as the blind wandering Yakuza. During Akira Kurosawa's 5 year hiatus from filmmaking, he watched a lot of television and was particularly taken by the final episode of Shin Zatouichi - Episode: Journey of Dreams (1978). The influence of this particular episode included the initial casting of Shintaro Katsu in the lead roles in Kagemusha and the extended artistic dream sequences contributed to those seen in Kagemusha (1980).\n\nOn the first anniversary of his death, April 14, 2002, a DVD box set containing his best known work was released in Japan in commemoration.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Hiroshi Teshigahara, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

While a teenager, he moved to the United States and directed a series of short films and documentaries. Universal Studios hired Hessler as a story reader for the Alfred Hitchcock Presents television series. He became story editor for two seasons (1960\u20131962) for that series, then served as the associate producer for The Alfred Hitchcock Hour from 1962 until its cancellation in 1965. He directed episodes of that series and several other shows (including Hawaii Five-O).\n\nIn 1969, he directed his debut feature film, The Oblong Box, starring Vincent Price. It was the first of three horror films Hessler would direct with the veteran horror star, the other two being Cry of the Banshee (1970) and Scream and Scream Again (1970). Hessler's other films include Murders in the Rue Morgue (1971), The Golden Voyage of Sinbad (1974) and The Girl in a Swing (1988) starring Meg Tilly, an adaptation of Richard Adams's ghost story novel.

        "biography": "John Nicholas Cassavetes was a Greek-American actor, film director, and screenwriter. Cassavetes was a pioneer of American independent film, writing and directing over a dozen movies, which he partially self-financed, and pioneered the use of improvisation and a realistic cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style. He also acted in many Hollywood films, notably Rosemary's Baby (1968) and The Dirty Dozen (1967). He studied acting with Don Richardson, using an acting technique based on muscle memory. \n\nBy 1956, Cassavetes had begun teaching an alternative to method acting in his own workshop in New York City. An improvisation exercise in his workshop inspired the idea for his writing and directorial debut, Shadows. Cassavetes raised the funds for the production from friends and family, as well as listeners to Jean Shepherd's late-night radio talk-show Night People. His stated purpose was to make a film about little people, different from Hollywood studio productions.\n\nCassavetes was unable to gain American distribution of Shadows, but it won the Critics Award at the Venice Film Festival. European distributors later released the movie in the US as an import. With payment for his work on television, as well as a handful of film acting jobs, he was able to relocate to California and to make his subsequent films independent of any studio, as Shadows had been. \n\nFaces (1968) was the second film to be both directed and independently financed by Cassavetes. The film starring his wife Gena Rowlands, whom he had married during his struggling actor days, depicts the slow disintegration of a marriage. Faces was nominated for three Academy Awards. Around this time, Cassavetes formed \"Faces International\" as a distribution company to handle his films.\n\nIn 1970, Cassavetes directed and acted in Husbands, with Peter Falk and Ben Gazzara. They played a trio of married men on a spree in New York and London after the funeral of one of their best friends. Cassavetes stated this was a personal film for him; his older brother died at the age of 30.\n\nMinnie and Moskowitz (1971), about two unlikely lovers, featured Rowlands with Seymour Cassel. A Woman Under the Influence (1974) stars Rowlands as an increasingly troubled housewife. Rowlands received an Academy Award nomination, while Cassavetes was nominated for Best Director. In The Killing of a Chinese Bookie (1976), Ben Gazzara plays a small-time strip-club owner with a gambling habit, pressured by mobsters to commit a murder to pay off his debt. Opening Night (1977) Rowlands portrays an aging film star working in the theater and suffering a personal crisis. Cassavetes directed the film Gloria (1980), featuring Rowlands as a Mob moll who tries to protect an orphan boy. Rowlands earned another Best Actress nomination for it. \n\nAfter receiving the prognosis from his doctor that he had six months to live, Cassavetes made Love Streams (1984), which featured him as an aging playboy. It won the Golden Bear at the 34th Berlinale. Cassavetes died on February 3, 1989, at the age of 59. By then, he had amassed a collection of more than forty unproduced screenplays, as well as a novel, Husbands.\n\nThe New Yorker wrote that Cassavetes \"may be the most influential American director of the last half century\".\n\nDescription from the Wikipedia article John Cassavetes, licensed under CC-BY-SA.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nJack Ryan Kinney (March 29, 1909 \u2013 February 9, 1992) was an American animator, director and producer of animated shorts.\n\nJack Kinney attended John Muir Junior High School in Los Angeles, California (1925), and attended John C. Fremont High School (1926 - 1928) there with Roy Williams. Both Fremont football players, they would later be hired by Walt Disney in 1930 to work at the Walt Disney Studio on Hyperion Avenue. Often referring to himself as Kinney's best friend, Williams would go on to star as the \"Big Mooseketeer\" with head Mouseketeer Jimmie Dodd on the classic 1950s television program, \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" (1955 - 1958).\n\nKinney began his long career in cartoons at the Walt Disney Studios in 1931 as an animator on several shorts, including Santa's Workshop (released on December 10, 1932), The Band Concert (released on February 23, 1935), and Moose Hunters (released on April 17, 1937). He then became a director of cartoons at Disney, including as a sequence director for both Pinocchio and Dumbo and especially as a director in the shorts department, where he directed many cartoon shorts, mostly those starring Goofy (his brother Dick created the stories for the shorts), although he also directed a few Donald Duck cartoons as well, including the Academy Award-winning wartime propaganda film, Der Fuehrer's Face. He also served as director of most of the \"package films\" during the 1940s, including The Three Caballeros, Make Mine Music, and The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad. In the mid-1950s, he supervised new animation used to tie some of the old shorts together for Disney's television efforts.\n\nIn 1959, Jack left Disney to start (with his brother Dick) Jack Kinney Productions, an independent animation studio. Among other work they provided animation for King Features Syndicate's 1960 Popeye series.\n\nIn 1988, Kinney published a short memoir, Walt Disney and Assorted Other Characters: An Unauthorized Account of the Early Years at Disney's.\n\nKinney died on February 9, 1992 in Glendale, California at the age of 82.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Jack Kinney, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

One year after producing that movie, he was accused of being the person behind the infamous alien autopsy footage. However, this accusation has been withdrawn since after Ray Santilli was found to be the director.\n\nAftermath is the second in a trilogy of short films known as 'La Trilogia De La Muerte' (The Trilogy of Death). The first film, 'Awakening', runs for only 8 minutes. Created in 1990, it tells of a boy for whom time stops upon falling asleep in a classroom, only later realising that he had actually died and was experiencing an out-of-body phenomena. The 1994 sequel, 'Aftermath', runs at a significantly longer time of 32 minutes, which depicts defilement, mutilation, and necrophilia (see Necrophilia in popular culture for more). The 35 minute finale, 'Genesis' (1998), shows the life of a sculptor whose artwork comes to life while he turns to stone, his work gradually consuming him. The trilogy represents the three stages of life, and in each instance, Cerd\u00e0 shows how vulnerable we are to the whims of elements beyond our control; time, others, and material possessions respectively.\n\nCerd\u00e0 also directed The Abandoned which is about an American film producer who returns to her homeland, Russia, to discover the truth about her family history. The film was first released in the US as part of the After Dark Horrorfest in November 2006. The film received a stand alone release in theaters in February 2007. The DVD was released on June 19, 2007.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Nacho Cerd\u00e0, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nEdward Davis Wood, Jr. (October 10, 1924 \u2013 December 10, 1978), better known as Ed Wood, was an American screenwriter, director, producer, actor, author, and editor, who often performed many of these functions simultaneously. In the 1950s, Wood made a number of cheap genre films, now enjoyed for their technical errors, unsophisticated special effects, large amounts of ill-fitting stock footage, idiosyncratic dialogue, eccentric casts and outlandish plot elements, although his flair for showmanship gave his projects at least a modicum of critical success.\n\nWood's popularity waned soon after his biggest \"name\" star, B\u00e9la Lugosi, died. He was able to salvage a saleable feature from Lugosi's last moments on film, but his career declined thereafter. Toward the end of his life, Wood made pornographic movies and wrote pulp crime, horror, and sex novels. His infamy began two years after his death, when he was awarded a Golden Turkey Award as Worst Director of All Time.[1] The lack of filmmaking ability in his work has earned Wood and his films a considerable cult following.\n\nFollowing the publication of Rudolph Grey's biography Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood, Jr. (1992), Wood's life and work have undergone a public rehabilitation of sorts, with new light shed on his evident zeal and honest love of movies and movie production. Tim Burton's biopic of the director's life, Ed Wood, earned two Academy Awards.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Ed Wood, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

It was produced and directed by Harvey for an estimated $33,000. Harvey had witnessed the recent success of Elmer Rhoden Jr. and fellow industrial filmmaker Robert Altman in producing low-budget feature films in nearby Kansas City, and began to secure backing from local investors in order to mount a similar project in Lawrence. While returning to Kansas after shooting a Centron film in California, Harvey developed the idea for Carnival of Souls after driving past the abandoned Saltair Pavilion in Salt Lake City, Utah. Hiring an unknown New York actress, Lee Strasberg-trained Hilligoss, and otherwise employing mostly local talent, Harvey shot Carnival of Souls in three weeks, on location in Lawrence and Salt Lake City, using a script penned by Centron associate John Clifford. Harvey also played an uncredited role as the film's most prominent \"ghoul.\" Originally marketed as a B film and released by an upstart distribution company that quickly went bankrupt, Carnival of Souls never gained widespread public attention upon its original release but today has become hailed as a cult classic. Set to an organ score by Gene Moore, Carnival of Souls relies more on atmosphere than on special effects to create its mood of psychological horror. The film has a large cult following, built up primarily via late-night television screenings, and has been released on DVD by the Criterion Collection (complete with a host of special features, including an hour of excerpts from Harvey's Centron productions). To this day, the movie is still discussed by film buffs and occasionally has screenings at Halloween and art film festivals.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Herk Harvey, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nIvan Sen is an Australian filmmaker. Throughout the late 1990s Sen worked on numerous short films, before making his feature film debut with Beneath Clouds in 2002. He studied filmmaking at the Australian Film Television and Radio School, where he produced his first short films, working with the crew he continues to work with today. Sen was raised in Inverell, New South Wales, Australia.\n\nSen drew on his own background as the child of an Aboriginal mother and an absent white father for the screenplay of his first feature-length work, Beneath Clouds, filmed on a $2.5 million dollar budget. The film follows two teenagers, Lena (Dannielle Hall) and Vaughn (Damian Pitt) who are hitchhiking their way from a rural New South Wales town to Sydney, each for different reasons. The film explores many of the racial difficulties in their society as well as the way the choices each makes can effect how they turn out. The film was based on Ivan Sen's own experiences of growing up in Alice Springs with an Aboriginal mother and absent European father. It won Sen global acclaim, screening at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival and winning the Premiere First Movie Award at the 2002 Berlin Film Festival and the 2002 Best Director Award at the Australian Film Institute Awards.\n\nIn 2009, the Message Sticks Indigenous Film Festival held at the Sydney Opera House saw the world premiere of Sen's Fire Talker, a documentary biopic about political activist, Aboriginal footballer, Charlie Perkins. It premiered at the 10th Anniversary of the Message Sticks Indigenous Film Festival held at the Sydney Opera House in May 2009.\n\nSen's second feature-length film, Dreamland, screened at the 2010 Melbourne International Film Festival.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Ivan Sen,licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Her mother remarried when she was nine. Her passion for movies came at an early age, but becoming a director was her goal. \"I wanted to do something more meaningful than going to auditions\u2026\"\n\nLemmons is married to actor and director Vondie Curtis-Hall. They have a son, Henry Hunter (born 1996), and a daughter, Zora (1999). Lemmons states that her husband is immensely supportive and feels that he is more relaxed than she is. Compared to how he works, she prefers the pressure of working on a set with the actors. As a director and a mother, Lemmons says that it gives her perspective. Her life outside of the movie set and Hollywood has kept her grounded. Though she is a Black woman, Lemmons identifies herself as an artist first and foremost in her career. \"\u2026I don\u2019t wake up every day saying I\u2019m a Black woman because it\u2019s too given, but I wake up every day feeling like an artist and I feel I\u2019m an artist.\"\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Kasi Lemmons, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia\n\nAustin Cedric Gibbons (March 23, 1893 \u2013 July 26, 1960) was an Irish art director and production designer for the film industry. He also made a significant contribution to motion picture theater architecture from the 1930s to 1950s. He is credited as the designer of the Oscar statuette in 1928.\n\nGibbons was born in Dublin, Ireland and studied at the Art Students League of New York and worked for his architect father. While at Edison Studios from 1915, he first designed a set for a film released in 1919, assisting Hugo Ballin. But, after this first foray, the studio closed, and he signed with Samuel Goldwyn in 1918. This evolved to working for Louis B. Mayer at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer from 1924 to 1956\u2014a 32-year career.\n\nGibbons was one of the original 36 founding members of The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and oversaw the design of the Academy Awards statuette in 1928, a trophy for which he himself would be nominated 39 times, winning 11.\n\nHe retired in 1956 with about 1,500 films credited to him: however, his contract with MGM dictated that he receive credit as art director for every MGM film released in the United States, even though other designers may have done the bulk of the work. Even so, his actual hands-on art direction may have been on about 150 films.\n\nIn 1930, Gibbons married actress Dolores del R\u00edo and co-designed their house in Santa Monica, an intricate Art Deco residence influenced by Rudolf Schindler. They divorced in 1941; three years later he married actress Hazel Brooks with whom he remained until his death at the age of 67.\n\nGibbons's grave is in the Calvary Cemetery, East Los Angeles.",

The Dziga Vertov Group borrowed his name. In 1960, Jean Rouch used Vertov's filming theory when making Chronicle of a Summer. His partner Edgar Morin coined Cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 term when describing the style, using direct translation of Vertov\u2019s KinoPravda. The Free Cinema movement in the United Kingdom during the 1950s, the Direct Cinema in North America in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and the Candid Eye series in Canada in the 1950s, all essentially owed a debt to Vertov.\n\nIn the 2012 Sight &amp; Sound poll, critics voted Vertov's Man with a Movie Camera (1929) the 8th best film ever made.",

        "biography": "\u200bFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nDavid Llewelyn Wark Griffith (January 22, 1875 \u2013 July 23, 1948) was a premier pioneering American film director. He is best known as the director of the controversial and groundbreaking 1915 film The Birth of a Nation and the subsequent film Intolerance (1916).\n\nGriffith's film The Birth of a Nation made pioneering use of advanced camera and narrative techniques, and its immense popularity set the stage for the dominance of the feature-length film. It also proved extremely controversial at the time and ever since for its negative depiction of Black Americans and their supporters, and its positive portrayal of slavery and the Ku Klux Klan. Griffith responded to his critics with his next film, Intolerance, intended to show the dangers of prejudiced thought and behavior. The film was not the financial success that its predecessor had been, but was received warmly by critics. Several of his later films were also successful, but high production, promotional, and roadshow costs often made his ventures commercial failures. Even so, he is generally considered one of the most important figures of early cinema.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article D. W.

        "biography": "Samuel Michael Fuller (August 12, 1912 \u2013 October 30, 1997) was an American screenwriter, novelist and film director known for low-budget genre movies with controversial themes.\n\nHe was born Samuel Michael Fuller in Worcester, Massachusetts, the son of Benjamin Rabinovitch, a Jewish immigrant\u00a0 from Russia, and Rebecca Baum, a Jewish immigrant from Poland. After immigrating to America, the family's surname was changed from Rabinovitch to \"Fuller\" possibly by inspiration of a Doctor who arrived in America on the Mayflower.\u00a0 At the age of 12, he began working in journalism\u00a0 as a newspaper\u00a0 copyboy. He became a crime reporter\u00a0 in New York City at age 17, working for the New York Evening Graphic. He broke the story of Jeanne Eagels' death.\u00a0 He wrote pulp novels and screenplays\u00a0 from the mid-1930s onwards. Fuller also became a screenplay\u00a0 ghostwriter\u00a0 but would never tell interviewers which screenplays that he ghost-wrote explaining \"that's what a ghost writer is for\".\n\nDuring World War II, Fuller joined the United States Army infantry. He was assigned to the 16th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division, and saw heavy fighting. He was involved in landings in Africa, Sicily, and Normandy\u00a0 and also saw action in Belgium and Czechoslovakia. In 1945 he was present at the liberation of the German concentration camp at Falkenau\u00a0 and shot 16 mm footage which was used later in the documentary Falkenau: The Impossible. For his service, he was awarded the Bronze Star, the Silver Star, and the Purple Heart.\u00a0 Fuller used his wartime experiences as material in his films, especially in The Big Red One (1980), a nickname of the 1st Infantry Division.\n\nAfter his controversial film \"White Dog\" was shelved by Paramount pictures, Fuller moved to France, and never directed another American film. Fuller eventually returned to America. He died of natural causes in his California home. In November 1997, the Directors Guild held a three hour memorial in his honor, hosted by Curtis Hanson, his long time friend and co-writer on White Dog. He was survived by his wife Christa and daughter Samantha.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nRobert Fuest (born in 1927 in London) is an English film director, screenwriter, and production designer who has worked mostly in the horror, fantasy and suspense genres.\n\nFuest's most highly praised and popular films, which feature strong black comedy undertones, include perennial cult favorites The Abominable Dr. Phibes (1971), Dr. Phibes Rises Again (1972), and The Final Programme (aka The Last Days of Man on Earth) (1973). Other films include And Soon the Darkness (1970), a straightforward suspense thriller which received considerable critical acclaim but little commercial success, and The Devil's Rain (1975), a horror film shot in the U.S. The latter movie received such scathing reviews it may arguably have killed off his once promising career, as Fuest immediately thereafter found himself relegated to directing fairly anonymous television work. His only subsequent theatrical release to date has been Aphrodite (1982), a soft-core sex movie filmed in Greece.\n\nHis television work included Revenge of the Stepford Wives and three episodes of The New Avengers.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Robert Fuest, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "Jon Stewart \u00a0(born Jonathan Stuart Leibowitz; November 28, 1962) is an American political satirist, writer, television host, actor, media critic and stand-up comedian. He is widely known as host of The Daily Show, a satirical news program that airs on Comedy Central.\n\nStewart started as a stand-up comedian, but branched into television as host of Short Attention Span Theater for Comedy Central. He went on to host his own show on MTV, called The Jon Stewart Show, and then hosted another show on MTV called You Wrote It, You Watch It. He has also had several film roles as an actor. Stewart became the host of The Daily Show on Comedy Central in early 1999. He is also a writer and co-executive-producer of the show. After Stewart joined, The Daily Show steadily gained popularity and critical acclaim, which led to his first Emmy Award in 2001.\n\nStewart has gained acclaim as an acerbic, satirical critic of personality-driven media shows, in particular those of the US media networks such as CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC. Critics say Stewart benefits from a double standard: he critiques other news shows from the safe, removed position of his \"fake news\" desk. Stewart agrees, saying that neither his show nor his channel purports to be anything other than satire and comedy. In spite of its self-professed entertainment mandate, The Daily Show has been nominated for news and journalism awards. Stewart hosted the 78th and 80th Academy Awards. He is the co-author of America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction, which was one of the best-selling books in the U.S. in 2004 and Earth (The Book): A Visitor's Guide to the Human Race released in 2010.

He was born in Paris, France.\n\nHe first came into prominence - just after Bim - for directing and producing White Mane (1953), an award winning short film that tells a fable of how a young boy befriends an untamable wild white stallion in the marshes of Camargue (the Petite Camargue).\n\nHis best known work is the short film The Red Balloon (1956), which earned him the Palme d'Or Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, and an Oscar for writing the best original screenplay in 1956.\n\nLamorisse also wrote, directed and produced the well-regarded films Stowaway in the Sky (1960) and Circus Angel, as well as the documentaries Versailles and Paris Jamais Vu. In addition to films, he created the popular strategy board game Risk in 1957.\n\nLamorisse and his wife had three children: Pascal, a son, and two daughters named Sabine and Fanny. Pascal and Sabine were featured in The Red Balloon. Albert Lamorisse died in a helicopter crash while filming the documentary Le Vent des amoureux (The Lovers' Wind), during a helicopter-tour of Iran in 1970. His son and his widow completed the film, based on his production notes, and released the film eight years later, in 1978.

He died in \u00c4ngelholm, Sk\u00e5ne l\u00e4n, Sweden of stomach cancer.\n\nWiderberg was the director of films such as Raven's End (1963), Elvira Madigan (1967), \u00c5dalen 31 (1969), Joe Hill (1971), Fimpen (1974), The Man on the Roof (1976), Victoria (1979), The Man from Majorca (1984), The Serpent's Way (1986) and All Things Fair (1995).\n\nHe won a Silver Bear prize in Berlin for All things fair and a Special Grand Jury Prize at Cannes Festival for \u00c5dalen 31. Raven's End, \u00c5dalen 31 and All things fair all received a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar Nomination\n\nBo Widerberg's vision of Swedish cinema parted radically with its contemporary form. He called for a greater political significance and more progressive story telling. Bergman being the leading figure of Swedish cinema, was not his ideal at all, although he recognized his position: \"Nor me or my friends saw very much in him. We didn't find the issue of god's existence that damn important. But it's safe to say you'd be putting yourself in a bad position if you're trying to slit the throat of the father figure before your own debut.\" In his book A vision of Swedish cinema he concluded that Ingmar Bergman's films almost exclusively dealt with issues directed upwards, but more seldom in sideways, between people. According to Widerberg, Bergman made vertical films when the need for horizontal ones was most dire. On the other hand, Widerberg wanted film to be a tool of the social sciences, a kind of sociological report.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Bo Widerberg, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.\n\n\u200b",

        "biography": "Jean Vigo was a French film director who helped establish poetic realism in film in the 1930s; he was a posthumous influence on the French New Wave of the late 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nVigo was born to Emily Clero and the prominent Catalan militant anarchist Eugeni Bonaventura de Vigo i Sall\u00e9s (who adopted the name Miguel Almereyda\u2014an anagram of \"y'a la merde\", which translates as \"there's shit\"). Much of Jean's early life was spent on the run with his parents. His father was imprisoned and murdered in Fresnes Prison on 13 August 1917. The young Vigo was subsequently sent to boarding school under an assumed name, Jean Sales, to conceal his identity.\n\nVigo is noted for two films that affected the future development of both French and world cinema: Zero for Conduct (1933) and L'Atalante (1934). Zero for Conduct was approvingly described by critic David Thomson as \"forty-four minutes of sustained, if roughly shot anarchic crescendo.\" L'Atalante was Vigo's only full-length feature. The simple story of a newly married couple splitting and reuniting is notable for the way it effortlessly merges rough, naturalistic filmmaking with shimmering, dreamlike sequences and effects. Thomson described the result as \"not so much a masterpiece as a definition of cinema, and thus a film that stands resolutely apart from the great body of films.\" \n\nHis career began with two other films: \u00c0 propos de Nice (\"about Nice,\" 1930), a subversive silent film inspired by Soviet newsreels which considered social inequity in the resort town of Nice; and Jean Taris, Swimming Champion (1931), a study of swimmer Jean Taris. None of his four films were financial successes; at one point, with his and his wife's health suffering, Vigo was forced to sell his camera.\n\nVigo was married and had a daughter, Luce Vigo (a film critic) in 1931.\n\nZero for Conduct was banned by the French government until after the war, and L'Atalante was mutilated by its distributor. By this point, Vigo was too ill to strenuously fight the matter. Both films have outlived their detractors; L'Atalante was chosen as the 10th-greatest film of all time in Sight &amp; Sound's 1962 poll, and as the 6th-best in its 1992 poll. In the late 1980s a 1934 copy of L'Atalante was found in the British National Film and Television Archive, and became a key element in the restoration of the film to its original version.\n\nWriting on Vigo's career in The New York Times, film critic Andrew Johnston stated: \"The ranks of the great film directors are short on Keatses and Shelleys, young artists cut off in their prime, leaving behind a handful of great works that suggest what might have been. But one who qualifies is Jean Vigo, the French director who died of tuberculosis at age 29 in 1934.\u201d\n\n2011 Parajanov-Vartanov Institute Award posthumously honored Jean Vigo for Zero for Conduct and was presented to his daughter Luce Vigo.",

An Academy Award-winner for True Grit (1969), Wayne was among the top box office draws for three decades.\n\nBorn in Winterset, Iowa, Wayne grew up in Southern California. He was president of Glendale High class of 1925. He found work at local film studios when he lost his football scholarship to the University of Southern California as a result of a bodysurfing accident. Initially working for the Fox Film Corporation, he appeared mostly in small bit parts. His first leading role came in Raoul Walsh's The Big Trail (1930), which led to leading roles in numerous B movies throughout the 1930s, many of them in the Western genre.\n\nWayne's career took off in 1939, with John Ford's Stagecoach making him an instant star. He went on to star in 142 pictures. Biographer Ronald Davis said, \"John Wayne personified for millions the nation's frontier heritage. Eighty-three of his movies were Westerns, and in them, he played cowboys, cavalrymen, and unconquerable loners extracted from the Republic's central creation myth.\"\n\nWayne's other well-known Western roles include a cattleman driving his herd north on the Chisholm Trail in Red River (1948), a Civil War veteran whose young niece is abducted by a tribe of Comanches in The Searchers (1956), and a troubled rancher competing with a lawyer for a woman's hand in marriage in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962). He is also remembered for his roles in The Quiet Man (1952), Rio Bravo (1959), and The Longest Day (1962). In his final screen performance, he starred as an aging gunfighter battling cancer in The Shootist (1976). He appeared with many important Hollywood stars of his era, and his last public appearance was at the Academy Awards ceremony on April 9, 1979.",

His best known film is A Night to Remember which won a Golden Globe for best foreign English language film in 1959. His later career was varied, and included many horror films and television shows.\n\nBaker's early career, from 1934 to 1939, was spent working for Gainsborough Pictures, a British film production company based in Islington, North London, famous for its prestige productions. His first jobs were menial - making tea for crew members, for example - but by 1938 he had risen through the ranks to work as assistant director on Alfred Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes.\n\nHe served in the army during World War II, until transferring to the Army Kinematograph Unit in 1943 in order to make better use of skills developed in his pre-war career producing documentaries and teaching materials for troops. One of his superiors at the time was novelist Eric Ambler. It was he who gave Baker his first big break directing The October Man, from an Ambler screenplay, in 1947. Ambler also adapted Walter Lord's A Night to Remember for Baker's 1958 screen version.\n\nDuring the early 1950s, Baker worked for three years in Hollywood where he directed Marilyn Monroe in Don't Bother to Knock (1952) and Robert Ryan in 3D film noir Inferno (1953). He returned to the UK for the latter part of the decade, but defected to television in the early 1960s.\n\nHe directed episodes of The Avengers, The Saint and The Champions - all adventure series created with an eye on the American market. The low-budget ethic of television production made him well-suited to his next career move into cheaply produced but lavish-looking British horror films. He directed, amongst others, Quatermass and the Pit (1967) The Vampire Lovers (1970) and Scars of Dracula (1970) for Hammer, and Asylum (1972) for Amicus.\n\nIn the latter part of the 1970s he returned to television, and throughout the 1980s continued to work in Television.\u00a0 He retired in 1992.",

He has written prolifically for TV, radio, film and stage, finding prominence with plays such as Arcadia, The Coast of Utopia, Every Good Boy Deserves Favour, Professional Foul, The Real Thing, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead. He co-wrote the screenplays for Brazil and Shakespeare in Love and has won one Academy Award and four Tony Awards. Themes of human rights, censorship and political freedom pervade his work along with exploration of linguistics and philosophy. Stoppard has been a key playwright of the National Theatre and is one of the most internationally performed dramatists of his generation.\n\nIn 1939, Stoppard left Czechoslovakia as a child refugee, fleeing imminent Nazi occupation. He settled with his family in Britain after the war, in 1946. After being educated at schools in Nottingham and Yorkshire, Stoppard became a journalist, a drama critic and then, in 1960, a playwright.

Born in Bay City, Michigan, she moved to New York City in 1977 to pursue a career in modern dance. After performing in the music groups Breakfast Club and Emmy, she released her debut album in 1983. She followed it with a series of albums in which she found immense popularity by pushing the boundaries of lyrical content in mainstream popular music and imagery in her music videos, which became a fixture on MTV. Throughout her career, many of her songs have hit number one on the record charts, including \"Like a Virgin\", \"Papa Don't Preach\", \"Like a Prayer\", \"Vogue\", \"Frozen\", \"Music\", \"Hung Up\", and \"4 Minutes\". Critics have praised Madonna for her diverse musical productions while at the same time serving as a lightning rod for religious controversy.\n\nHer career was further enhanced by film appearances that began in 1979, despite mixed commentary. She won critical acclaim and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for her role in Evita (1996), but has received harsh feedback for other film roles. Madonna's other ventures include being a fashion designer, children's book author, film director and producer. She has been acclaimed as a businesswoman, and in 2007, she signed an unprecedented US $120 million contract with Live Nation.\n\nMadonna has sold more than 300 million records worldwide and is recognized as the world's top-selling female recording artist of all time by the Guinness World Records. According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), she is the best-selling female rock artist of the 20th century and the second top-selling female artist in the United States, behind Barbra Streisand, with 64 million certified albums. In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked Madonna at number two, behind only The Beatles, on the Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists, making her the most successful solo artist in the history of the Billboard chart. She was also inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the same year. Considered to be one of the \"25 Most Powerful Women of the Past Century\" by Time for being an influential figure in contemporary music, Madonna is known for continuously reinventing both her music and image, and for retaining a standard of autonomy within the recording industry.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Madonna (entertainer), licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

In 1921 he began in motion pictures as an actor and directed his first silent film in 1923. He went on to direct more than one hundred and eighty films. The first full length motion picture he directed for MGM was Last of the Pagans (1935) starring Ray Mala. After directing The Last Challenge in 1967, he retired from the film industry. He died in Palm Springs, California in 1991.\n\nThorpe is also known as the original director of The Wizard of Oz. He was fired after two weeks of shooting, because it was felt that his scenes did not have the right air of fantasy about them. Thorpe notoriously gave Judy Garland a blonde wig and cutesy \"baby-doll\" makeup that made her look like a girl in her late teens rather than an innocent Kansas farm girl of about thirteen. Both makeup and wig were discarded at the suggestion of George Cukor, who was brought in temporarily. Stills from Thorpe's work on the film survive today.\n\nFor his contribution to the motion picture industry, Thorpe has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6101 Hollywood Blvd.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Richard Thorpe, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia\u200b",

He attended the\u00a0University of California, Los Angeles\u00a0but dropped out when he was not admitted into the film school in his third year.\u00a0As an unpaidintern\u00a0for a Hollywood agent, he gained attention for a screenplay he wrote called\u00a0Swings. This led to a meeting where he successfully pitched\u00a0Racing with the Moon\u00a0(1984).  His first experience with professional screenwriting left him wanting more interaction with the actors so that the characters would stay true to his vision.\u00a0Kloves wrote\u00a0The Fabulous Baker Boys\u00a0and also intended it to be his directorial debut. After years of trying to sell the project in Hollywood, the film finally got off the ground and was released in 1989.\u00a0The Fabulous Baker Boys\u00a0did reasonably well, but his next shot as writer/director for\u00a0Flesh and Bone\u00a0in 1993 fared poorly at the box office. Kloves then stopped writing for three years.  Realizing that he had to return to writing to support his family, he began adapting\u00a0Michael Chabon's novel\u00a0Wonder Boys\u00a0into a screenplay.\u00a0Kloves was offered the chance to direct but he declined, preferring to direct only his own original work.\u00a0This was his first try at adapting another work to film.\u00a0His screenplay was nominated for a\u00a0Golden Globe\u00a0and an\u00a0Academy Award\u00a0after the film's release in 2000.  Warner Bros.\u00a0sent Kloves a list of novels that the company was considering to adapt as films. The listing included the\u00a0first\u00a0Harry Potter\u00a0novel, which intrigued him despite his usual indifference to these catalogs.\u00a0He went on to write the screenplays for the first four films in the series. After\u00a0Michael Goldenberg\u00a0wrote the screenplay for the fifth film, Kloves then returned to write the sixth, seventh and eighth installments.  As of 2011, Kloves is working on a film adaptation of\u00a0Mark Haddon's novel\u00a0The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, which he will write and direct.\u00a0He has also a draft written\u00a0of the yet unproduced fantasy film Akira.",

Germi was born in Genoa, Liguria, to a lower-middle class family. He was a messenger and briefly attended nautical school before deciding on a career in acting.\n\nHe studied acting and directing at Rome's Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia. During his time in school, Germi supported himself by working as an extra, bit actor, assistant director, and, on occasion, writer. Germi made his directorial debut in 1945 with the film Il testimone. His early work, this film included, were very much in the Italian Neorealist style; many were social dramas that dealt with contemporary issues pertaining to people of Sicilian heritage.\n\nThrough the years, Germi shifted away from social drama towards satirical comedies, but retained his loved element of the Sicilian people. In the 1960s, Germi received worldwide success with the films Divorce, Italian Style, Seduced and Abandoned, and Signore e Signori. The latter is better known in the English-speaking world as The Birds the Bees and the Italians. He was nominated for Academy Awards in both directing and writing for Divorce, Italian Style, and, subsequently, won in the writing category. He also won the Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival for Signore e signori.\n\nGermi collaborated on the scripts for all the films he directed and appeared as an actor in a few of them.

Parker was the first professional athlete to earn an average of one million dollars per year, having signed a 5-year, $5 million dollar contract in January 1979. Nolan Ryan is often erroneously cited as the first player to average $1 million+ per season. However, Ryan signed his deal of 4-years, $4.5 million in November 1979, a full ten months after Parker's contract. Parker's career achievements include 2712 hits, 339 home runs, 1493 runs batted in and a lifetime batting average of .290. Parker was also known as a solid defensive outfielder during the first half of his career, with a powerful arm. From 1975 to 1979, he threw out 72 runners, including 26 in 1977.\n\nHe was a baseball All-Star in 1977, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1985, 1986, and 1990. In the 1979 All-Star Game, Parker showcased his defensive ability and powerful arm by throwing out Jim Rice at third base and Angels catcher Brian Downing at home.

To date, he has directed five feature films, all of which border somewhere between realistic drama and the avant-garde. His films have won several awards at the Cannes Film Festival. Two of Dumont's films have won the Grand Prix award: both L'Humanit\u00e9 (1999) and Flandres (2006). Dumont's Hadewijch won the 2009 Prize of the International Critics (FIPRESCI Prize) for Special Presentation at the Toronto Film Festival, and will be distributed in France in 2009, and by IFC in the U.S. in 2010.\n\nDumont has a background of Greek and German (Western) philosophy, and of corporate video. His films often show the ugliness of extreme violence and provocative sexual behavior, and are usually classified as art films. Dumont has himself likened his films to visual arts, and he typically uses long takes, close-ups of people's bodies, and story lines involving extreme emotions. Dumont does not write traditional scripts for his films. Instead, he writes complete novels which are then the basis for his filmmaking.\n\nHe says that some of his favorite filmmakers are Stanley Kubrick, Ingmar Bergman, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Roberto Rossellini, and Abbas Kiarostami. He is frequently considered an artistic heir to Robert Bresson.\n\nHis work has been associated with the New French Extremity. His film Outside Satan premiered in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Bruno Dumont, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.\u200b",

        "biography": "Apr\u00e8s avoir suivi sa scolarit\u00e9 dans l'internat de Philippeville (province de Namur) o\u00f9 son p\u00e8re est administrateur, Lucas Belvaux d\u00e9cide, \u00e0 16 ans, d'abandonner ses \u00e9tudes et de partir pour Paris, afin de devenir com\u00e9dien. Inscrit dans un cours priv\u00e9, il rencontre rapidement un agent qui lui permet de trouver ses premiers r\u00f4les dans des t\u00e9l\u00e9films.\u00a0\n\nEn 1981, Lucas Belvaux fait ses d\u00e9buts au cin\u00e9ma, en jeune homme insoumis, dans\u00a0Allons z'enfants, le plaidoyer anti-militariste d'Yves Boisset. Aper\u00e7u chezLosey\u00a0et\u00a0Zulawski, le com\u00e9dien tourne en 1985 avec deux ma\u00eetres de la Nouvelle vague,\u00a0Claude Chabrol\u00a0(Poulet au vinaigre, dans lequel il incarne un facteur trop bavard) et\u00a0Jacques Rivette\u00a0(Hurlevent, variation autour de l'oeuvre d'Emily Bront\u00eb). Entre na\u00efvet\u00e9 et romantisme, Lucas Belvaux campe un amoureux du rock dans\u00a0D\u00e9sordre, premier long m\u00e9trage d'Olivier Assayas\u00a0en 1986, et un clerc de notaire qui s\u00e9duit\u00a0Madame Bovary\u00a0dans l'adaptation par Chabrol du chef-d'oeuvre de Flaubert (1991).\n\nAu d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 90, Lucas Belvaux passe derri\u00e8re la cam\u00e9ra. Auteur d'une premi\u00e8re oeuvre intimiste pass\u00e9e un peu inaper\u00e7ue (Parfois trop d'amour), il obtient les faveurs de la critique et du public avec\u00a0Pour rire !\u00a0(1996), vaudeville d\u00e9cal\u00e9 qui r\u00e9v\u00e8le son sens du casting (Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud/Ornella Muti). Fort de ce succ\u00e8s, il se lance dans un triptyque compos\u00e9 d'une com\u00e9die (Un couple \u00e9patant), d'un\u00a0thriller\u00a0(Cavale) et d'un m\u00e9lodrame (Apr\u00e8s la vie), les personnages principaux de chaque film devenant les personnages secondaires des deux autres. Le Prix Louis-Delluc viendra couronner en 2005 ce projet aussi ludique qu'ambitieux.\u00a0\n\nLucas Belvaux continue de faire l'acteur, chez\u00a0Herv\u00e9 Le Roux\u00a0(On appelle \u00e7a... le printemps),\u00a0Akerman,\u00a0Christian Carion,\u00a0R\u00e9gis Wargnier\u00a0(Pars vite et reviens tard) ou\u00a0Robert Gu\u00e9diguian, son producteur via la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Agat Films. Il joue aussi l'un des r\u00f4les principaux de son sixi\u00e8me long m\u00e9trage comme r\u00e9alisateur,\u00a0La Raison du plus faible\u00a0(2006), polar humaniste tourn\u00e9 dans sa Belgique natale. Puisant son inspiration dans la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 sociale, il r\u00e9alise pour la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision un film sur les formes d'\u00e9conomie alternative (Nature contre nature\u00a0), une fiction sur l'affaire Elf (2007). Et pour le grand \u00e9cran, il signe en 2009\u00a0Rapt, une oeuvre \u00e2pre et intense, d'apr\u00e8s un fait divers retentissant : l'enl\u00e8vement du Baron Empain.",

Hickox was born in London, where he was educated at Emanuel School. Hickox worked extensively as an assistant director and second unit director throughout the 50's and early 60's, making his first major picture in 1970. Over the next ten years, he developed a reputation for the wit and style of his direction, and for his taut action sequences. His work includes Les Bicyclettes de Belsize (1968), Entertaining Mr Sloane (1969), Theatre of Blood (1973) and Zulu Dawn (1979).\n\nHickox was married to Anne V. Coates, the Oscar winning editor of Lawrence of Arabia. After his death in 1988, his second wife Annabel approached the BIFA (British Independent Film Awards) with an annual bequest from Douglas' estate. This bequest led directly to the creation of the British Independent Film Awards. In recognition of Douglas's commitment and support for new talent, BIFA inaugurated the Douglas Hickox Award, which is given to a British director on their debut feature.\n\nDouglas Hickox's sons, Anthony Hickox and James D.R. Hickox are also film directors and one of his daughters, Emma, a film editor. Anthony Hickox's best known work is perhaps Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth (1992), whilst he was Executive Producer on Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest (1995) directed by James D.R. Hickox. Emma E. Hickox's career has probably taken her the furthest though with films like The Jacket, Kinky Boots, Blood and Chocolate, Blue Crush, Becoming Jane and A Walk to Remember on her CV.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Douglas Hickox, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Her most famous film was Triumph des Willens (Triumph of the Will), made at the 1934 Nuremberg congress of the Nazi Party. Riefenstahl's prominence in the Third Reich along with her personal friendship with Adolf Hitler thwarted her film career following Germany's defeat in World War II, after which she was arrested but released without any charges.\n\nTriumph of the Will gave Riefenstahl instant and lasting international fame, as well as infamy. Although she directed only eight films, just two of which received significant coverage outside of Germany, Riefenstahl was widely known all her life. The propaganda value of her films made during the 1930s repels most modern commentators but many film histories cite the aesthetics as outstanding. The Economist wrote that Triumph of the Will \"sealed her reputation as the greatest female filmmaker of the 20th century\".\n\nIn the 1970s Riefenstahl published her still photography of the Nuba tribes in Sudan in several books such as The Last of the Nuba. She was active up until her death and also published marine life stills and released the marine-based film Impressionen unter Wasser in 2002.\n\nAfter her death, the Associated Press described Riefenstahl as an \"acclaimed pioneer of film and photographic techniques\". Der Tagesspiegel newspaper in Berlin noted, \"Leni Riefenstahl conquered new ground in the cinema\". The BBC said her documentaries \"were hailed as groundbreaking film-making, pioneering techniques involving cranes, tracking rails, and many cameras working at the same time\".\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Leni Riefenstahl, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

His 1996 book Tout contre L\u00e9o (Close to Leo) talks about HIV and is aimed at young adults; he made it into a movie in 2002. He wrote other books for young adults throughout the late 1990s. His first play, Les D\u00e9butantes, was performed at Avignon's Off Festival in 1998. In 2005, he returns to Avignon to present his latest creation, Dionysos impuissant, in the \"In\" Festival; Joana Preiss and Louis Garrel, who has acted in a number of Honor\u00e9 films, played the leads.\n\nA well-known director, he is considered an \"auteur\" in French Cinema. His 2006 film \"Dans Paris\" has led him to be considered by French critics as the heir to the Nouvelle Vague Cinema. In 2007, Les Chansons d'amour was one of the films selected to be in competition at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. Some of his movies or screenplays (like Les filles ne savent pas nager, Dix-sept fois C\u00e9cile Cassard and Les Chansons d'amour) deal with gay or lesbian relations.\n\nHonor\u00e9 has been the screenwriter for some of Ga\u00ebl Morel's films. He has also directed Romain Duris in two different films.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Christophe Honor\u00e9, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.\u200b",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.  Claude Chabrol (24 June 1930 \u2013 12 September 2010) was a French film director, a member of the French New Wave (nouvelle vague) group of filmmakers who first came to prominence at the end of the 1950s. Like his colleagues and contemporaries Godard, Truffaut, Rohmer and Rivette, Chabrol was a critic for the influential film magazine Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma before beginning his career as a film maker.  Chabrol's career began with Le Beau Serge (1958), inspired by Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt (1943). Thrillers became something of a trademark for Chabrol, with an approach characterized by a distanced objectivity. This is especially apparent in Les Biches (1968), La Femme Infid\u00e8le (1969) and Le Boucher (1970) \u2014 all featuring his then-wife, St\u00e9phane Audran. Sometimes characterized as a \"mainstream\" New Wave director, Chabrol remained prolific and popular throughout his half-century career. In 1978, he cast Isabelle Huppert as the lead in Violette Nozi\u00e8re. On the strength of that effort, the pair went on to others including the successful Madame Bovary (1991) and La Ceremonie (1996).

His most acclaimed feature, Gun Crazy (1949), is a dark romance about gun-obsession, and notable for its use of location photography.\n\nAt the dawn of his career (1937\u20131940), when Lewis was directing inexpensive westerns, he earned the derogatory nickname \"Wagon-Wheel Joe\" from the studio editors, because of his tendency to use wagon-wheels for constructing interesting visual compositions within the frame.\n\nLewis's offbeat and eye-catching compositions added style and value to inexpensive productions. His 1944 musical Minstrel Man, starring singer Benny Fields, is quite possibly the finest film ever made by low-budget PRC Pictures. Industry insiders noticed, prompting Columbia Pictures to hire Lewis to film the musical sequences for its blockbuster musical The Jolson Story.\n\nToward the end of Lewis's career, he worked in television, directing mostly westerns: The Rifleman, Bonanza, The Big Valley, Gunsmoke, and the pilot for Branded.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Joseph H.

Her maternal great-grandfather was composer Alfredo Casella.\n\nAsia Argento started acting at the age of nine,[9] playing a small role in a film by Sergio Citti. She also had a small part in Demons 2, a 1986 film written and produced by her father, at the age of 10, as well as its unofficial sequel, La Chiesa (The Church), when she was 14, and Trauma (1993), when she was 18. She received the David di Donatello (Italy's version of the Academy Award) for Best Actress in 1994 for her performance in Perdiamoci di vista, and again in 1996 for Compagna di viaggio, which also earned her a Grolla d'oro award. In 1998, Argento began appearing in English-language movies, such as B. Monkey and New Rose Hotel.\n\nArgento has proven her ability to work in multiple languages, adding French, with a role as Charlotte de Sauve in 1994's La Reine Margot. That same year, she made her first foray into directing, calling the shots behind the short films Prospettive and A ritroso. In 1996, she directed a documentary on her father, and in 1998 a second one on Abel Ferrara, which won her the Rome Film Festival Award.\n\nArgento directed and wrote her first movie, Scarlet Diva (2000), which her father co-produced. In 2002, she portrayed Russian undercover spy Yelena in the action film XXX alongside Vin Diesel. In 2004 she directed her second film The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things, based on a book by JT LeRoy, the pen name of Laura Albert, this time in the United States.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Asia Argento, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nPhil Karlson (July 2, 1908, Chicago, Illinois \u2013 December 12, 1985, Los Angeles, California) was a film director known for his no-nonsense film noirs. Karlson directed 99 River Street, Kansas City Confidential and Hell's Island all with actor John Payne in the early 1950s. Other films include Rocky (1948), The Phenix City Story (1955), 5 Against the House (1955) and The Young Doctors (1961).\n\nPhil Karlson was the son of popular Irish actress Lillian O'Brien.\n\nHe studied painting at Chicago's Art Institute, and law, at his father's request, at Loyola Marymount University in California.\n\nKarlson got into the film industry working as a prop man while a law student. After working a number of film jobs, including being an assistant director for a number of Abbott and Costello films, Karlson directed his first film in 1944 and in 1948 directed the first film starring Marilyn Monroe, Ladies of the Chorus. He worked on a number of low-budget projects for Monogram Pictures and Eagle-Lion Films before making his mark in 1950. It was then that he was known for directing tough, realistic and sometimes violent gritty crime films. In the 1960s the quality of his directed films declined, which included working on Kid Galahad (1962) with Elvis Presley and two Dean Martin Matt Helm spy films, including The Wrecking Crew (1969) co-starring Sharon Tate and Elke Sommer. He had his biggest success in 1973 when he directed the hit film, Walking Tall. The film made the director a rich man many times over, thanks to the fact that he owned a huge part of the movie.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Phil Karlson, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

        "biography": "Robert R. Parrish (born 4 January 1916, Columbus, Georgia \u2013 4 December 1995, Southampton, New York) was an American actor, film editor, film director, and writer. He received an Academy Award for Film Editing for the 1947 film, Body and Soul.\n\nParrish was the son of factory cashier Gordon R. Parrish and Laura R. Parrish. In the mid-1920s, the family moved from Georgia to Los Angeles and Parrish and his sisters Beverly and Helen began obtaining work as actors soon thereafter. Parrish made his film debut in the 1927 Our Gang short Olympic Games. (Their mother, Laura R. Parrish, was an actress as well and appeared in a few films of the 1940s.) He appeared in the anti-war classic All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) and Charles Chaplin's City Lights (1931), and in several films for John Ford.\n\nFord then enlisted him as an assistant editor in 1936 on Mary of Scotland, and as a sound editor on Young Mr Lincoln (1939). Parrish worked as an assistant editor and sound editor on other Ford movies as Drums Along the Mohawk (1939) and The Grapes of Wrath (1940). Parrish and Ford were in the United States Navy during the Second World War, and worked on documentary and training films including The Battle of Midway (1942).\n\nIn 1947 he won an Oscar for his debut as a feature film editor on Robert Rossen's high tempo boxing drama Body and Soul; the award was shared with Francis Lyon. Parrish was later nominated for another Rossen film \u2013 the political drama All the King\u2019s Men (1949); he shared the nomination with Al Clark.\n\nParrish went on to contribute his technical talents to a host of highly regarded films and made a promising directorial debut in 1951 with the gripping revenge melodrama, Cry Danger. His subsequent output met with varying success. The Purple Plain (1954) was nominated for \"Best British film\" at the 8th British Academy Film Awards. One of the most notorious of his films was the James Bond Parody Casino Royale (1967), in which he was one of the film's five directors. His last film, on which he shared co-director credit with Bertrand Tavernier, was Mississippi Blues (1983).\n\nParrish wrote two memoirs, Growing Up in Hollywood (1976) and its sequel Hollywood Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1988). Of the first, Kevin Brownlow wrote, \"His stories about these pictures were marvellous in themselves, and he often came at them sideways, so not only the punchline but the situation took you by surprise. We all entreated him to write them down and in 1976 he did so, producing one of the most enchanting - and hilarious - books about the picture business ever written. It was called Growing Up in Hollywood and it ought to be reprinted in this centenary year.\" Summing up Parrish's career, Allen Grant Richards wrote, \"Other than his excellent editing work and early directing, Parrish may be most remembered as storyteller from his two books of Hollywood memoirs.\"",

The couple were engaged within two months of meeting, with Holmes converting from Roman Catholicism to the Church of Scientology, and Cruise flamboyantly professing his love for her during a controversial episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show. Months later, the couple produced a daughter, Suri, before marrying in November 2006.\n\nHolmes went on to make her Broadway debut in a revival of Arthur Miller's All My Sons, portray Jacqueline Kennedy in the Reelz mini-series The Kennedys, and launched a short-lived fashion line. Holmes filed for divorce from Cruise in July 2012, gaining custody of her daughter and moving to New York, where she returned to the Roman Catholic Church. While tabloids have long speculated on the circumstances of the couple's divorce, Holmes has declined to speak publicly on the matter.\n\nFollowing her divorce, Holmes returned to film with roles in The Giver, Woman in Gold and Steven Soderbergh's Logan Lucky, and recurred on the Showtime series Ray Donovan.

His mother is French. His American father was in the US Air Force and served in the Second World War. Jean-Marc Barr is primarily known as an actor, but is also a film director, screenwriter and producer. Barr is bilingual in French and English: he speaks French with a nasal, hybrid accent, reminiscent of his American upbringing - with a slight American accent and occasional anglicisms in interviews - and English with a Mid-Atlantic accent.\n\nHe studied philosophy at the University of California, Los Angeles, the Paris Conservatoire and the Sorbonne. He went on to pursue an education in drama at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. In London he met his future wife, a pianist and composer Irina De\u010dermi\u0107.\n\nJean-Marc Barr began working in theatre in France in 1986. After some television roles and film work, in particular, Hope and Glory (1987) by John Boorman, he was cast in the tremendously successful The Big Blue (1988). Luc Besson cast him in the role of French diver Jacques Mayol. He played in the role opposite Rosanna Arquette and Jean Reno. The Big Blue was the most financially successful film in France in the 1980s.\n\nIn 1991, he starred in Danish director Lars von Trier's Europa, marking the beginning of a long friendship (he is the godfather of von Trier's children) as well as a significant professional relationship. He went on to appear in von Trier\u2019s Europa (1991), Breaking the Waves (1996), Dancer in the Dark (2000), Dogville (2004) and Manderlay (2005). Also in 2005 he starred in the French film Crustac\u00e9s et Coquillages.\n\nHis collaboration with von Trier put him on track to start directing his own work. He debuted in 1999 as a director, screenwriter and producer with the intimate love story Lovers. This film became the first part of a trilogy; the two subsequent parts being the drama Too Much Flesh (2000) and the comedy Being Light (2001) which he co-directed with Pascal Arnold.\n\nHe may also be recognized for his role as the attractive divorce lawyer, Maitre Bertram in the Merchant Ivory film le Divorce (2003). He appeared as Hugo in The Red Siren in 2002. He appeared as the main character in the video for Blur's 1995 single, \"Charmless Man\".\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Jean-Marc Barr, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Not only does he receive the Prix Jean Vigo for L'Enfant secret, he subsequently receives several prestigious awards, from the Cannes Festival and the Venice Film Festival.\n\nAfter receiving an award in 2005, Garrel said: \"I am a French independent filmmaker and I am proud that Italians recognize me. Italy is for me like a great university of cinema. \"\n\nHis works often deal with the theme of the disruptive youth of the 1960s, of which he was a part of.\n\nHe has directed students of the National Conservatory of Dramatic Art where he teaches acting classes. He also staged, in his films several of his friends and family members.",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nSeijun Suzuki born Seitaro Suzuki on May 24, 1923, is a Japanese filmmaker, actor, and screenwriter. His films are renowned by film enthusiasts worldwide for their jarring visual style, irreverent humour, nihilistic cool and entertainment-over-logic sensibility. He made 40 predominately B-movies for the Nikkatsu Company between 1956 and 1967, working most prolifically in the yakuza genre. His increasingly surreal style began to draw the ire of the studio in 1963 and culminated in his ultimate dismissal for what is now regarded his magnum opus, Branded to Kill (1967), starring notable collaborator Joe Shishido. Suzuki successfully sued the studio for wrongful dismissal, but he was blacklisted for 10 years after that. As an independent filmmaker, he won critical acclaim and a Japanese Academy Award for his Taish\u014d Trilogy, Zigeunerweisen (1980), Kagero-za (1981) and Yumeji (1991).\n\nHis films remained widely unknown outside of Japan until a series of theatrical retrospectives beginning in the mid 1980s, home video releases of key films such as Branded to Kill and Tokyo Drifter in the late 1990s and tributes by such acclaimed filmmakers as Jim Jarmusch, Takeshi Kitano, Wong Kar-wai and Quentin Tarantino signaled his international discovery. Suzuki has continued making films, albeit sporadically. In Japan, he is more commonly recognized as an actor for his numerous roles in Japanese films and television.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Seijun Suzuki, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Sherman  began his career in the movie business in the mail room at Warner  Brothers before working his way up to assistant director. By 1937, he  had graduated to directing in his own right under contract with  Republic. Sherman specialised almost exclusively in B-westerns,  (including the \"Three Mesqueteers\" series, which featured a young John Wayne),  with occasional forays into action and horror themes. He often achieved  a sense of style over substance. Indeed, as to his handling of the  'Mesqueteers', Variety commented on his imparting a \"poetry in motion\"  to his \"unified timing of cowboys mounting, riding, wheeling, galloping  and dismounting of steeds\" (July 2 1939). From 1940, Sherman also served  as associate producer on many of his films.\n\nThe diminutive (five  foot) Sherman turned out reliable low-budget fare for Columbia between  1945 and 1948, then moved on to do the same at Universal for another  eight years. Thereafter, he turned to free-lancing and working in  television. The only A-grade films to his credit were two westerns,  starring John Wayne: The Comancheros (1961), as producer; and Big Jake (1971), as director.\n\nDate of Birth  14\u00a0July  1908,\u00a0New York City, New York\n\nDate of Death  15\u00a0March  1991,\u00a0Los Angeles County, California",

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.  Mark Sandrich (birth name: Mark Rex Goldstein) (October 26, 1900 \u2013 March 4, 1945) was a Jewish American film director, writer and producer.\n\nOne of the most gifted and least heralded directors of the 1930s and early 1940s, Sandrich was an engineering student at Columbia University when he started the movie business by accident. When visiting a friend on a film set, he saw that the director had a problem in setting up a shot; Sandrich offered his advice. It worked. He then entered into the movies in the prop department, and became a director specializing in several comedy shorts in 1927. He then made his first feature the next year, but returned to shorts after the sound arrival. In 1933 he directed the Academy Award-winning short, So This Is Harris!. He later returned to feature films, most notably comedies, starring the team of Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey in Hips, Hips, Hooray!. In 1934, Sandrich soon got his first directing assignment on the Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers musical The Gay Divorcee, which proved a success.\n\nThe following year, he directed what is widely regarded as the best movie ever made by the legendary dance team, Top Hat, which excelled in every department, including music and choreography. It was all pulled together seamlessly by Sandrich. After that, several other movies such as Follow the Fleet, Shall We Dance, and Carefree followed. In 1940, Sandrich left RKO for Paramount, which offered him a chance to be not only a director but as well as a producer. He made other several successful films in this capacity, including two with Jack Benny, Buck Benny Rides Again and Love Thy Neighbor, both released in 1940, and the romantic comedy Skylark, starring Claudette Colbert and Ray Milland. However, while all these were hits, it was Holiday Inn in 1942 starring Fred Astaire and Bing Crosby, with music by Irving Berlin that showed Sandrich at his best. The musical/comedy actually started on the eve of America's entry into World War II. It featured sufficient serious overtones to capture the mood of the time, and showed Crosby and Astaire to brilliant advantage as performers who are rivals for the same woman; and it introduced the song \"White Christmas\", highlighted by the crooner Crosby which remained the biggest selling popular song in history for fifty-two years. So Proudly We Hail! was a Sandrich-produced and directed adaptation of the hit play. It was extremely popular and successful, and featured a pair of performers \u2013 Adrian Booth and George Reeves -- whom Sandrich had intended to bring to stardom after the war. However, it wasn't to be.\n\nIn 1945, while in pre-production on a follow up to Holiday Inn called Blue Skies, starring Bing Crosby and featuring Irving Berlin's music, and serving as president of the Directors Guild, Sandrich died suddenly, of heart failure. He was at this time one of the most trusted and influential directors in Hollywood, respected by his colleagues and the studio management. His sons Mark Sandrich Jr. and Jay Sandrich have gone onto successful careers as directors. His interment was located at Home of Peace Cemetery.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Mark Sandrich, licensed under CC-BY-SA,full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
